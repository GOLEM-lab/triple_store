This fic is inspired by a few others that were similar, but discontinued."

They learn more about the outside world than they thought they would be able to. Even if it's not their world."

However -- because Sasha Braus is not Sasha Braus without dumb decisions -- she ends up drinking it herself, making it so that Mikasa falls head over heels in love with her.

"The Harry Potter- Attack on Titan crossover no one asked for. except for one needy hoe. TL;DR When a persistant idiot and a blind hot-head, cause nothing but stress for each other, there seems but one way for them to channel their hatred into.

Why are you up here at this hour anyway?” The silhouette is moving alarmingly closer, and, yeah, it’s time for him to panic . “Stay back.

It was easy to love her then, when she was small enough to carry on his back wherever they went. When his feelings toward her had a name that he understood.

"“You really won’t talk, will you?” “I…I said…everything…already…you just won’t…hear me…” The man knelt down, becoming level with Jean, and he gently grasped his chin.

"The mood in the Survey Corps dining room was boisterous, almost celebratory. It was the evening before they would return to Shiganshina. Tomorrow was the day that would decide everything. Levi, on the other hand, did not feel like celebrating, because he already knew how it would end for him. He would lose what meant the most to him because Erwin had decided what was most important to him. Not them."

"“What’s your deal?” She asked him. He turned around while unbuttoning his wet work shirt. Watching him unbutton each one felt like a tease. “Like I said, you should probably get back to the main house.” He told her as he unbuttoned the last one. Blair was struggling to come up with a response. She figured Levi was in good shape from the physical labor, but she wasn’t expecting him to be so toned. She practically gasped at the sight of him. “Anything else?” He asked in a more demanding tone. “Yeah.” She was unexpectedly shy, her confidence waned and was fighting for anything worth saying to him. “I… um…” She mumbled the last part quietly while looking at her hands. He approached her and lifted her chin to look at him. “I can’t hear you when you’re mumbling. Say it clear.” Her face flushed from embarrassment. “I want to know what a good kiss feels like.” She said with more confidence. “I don’t know how to describe it.” He wanted to make her say it. Maybe it was an ego trip, maybe he got off on seeing his boss’ daughter tremble in front of him, embarrassed. She looked between his eyes and his lips. “Can you show me?”"

That is why, they stuck together. That is why they made the oath to always stay together in their large family. To keep each other close no matter what happened. No matter what was thrown their way. Because only the lot of them understood what it was like to be reincarnated with such fearsome memories. That oath however, will be tested, when the person they thought they could trust most, came into their lives all but to destroy everything they had worked for.

'Til the end."" A drunken promise between barely-friends, a desperate attempt to find some stability in a world of endless pain. Through the obscurity of it all one thing makes sense to him; Levi cannot fathom a version of this reality in which you do not exist, and he would sacrifice anything, damn the titans and everything else with them, to preserve your existence. He cannot begin to find the words to express this fundamental need for you, above all others, to stay alive. This feeling is untranslatable. All he can do is grip his glass a little tighter, bite down on his teeth, and swallow everything left unsaid. That's how it's always been between you both, a locked chest of unsaid things, a lexical gap of a relationship, and that's how Levi is determined to keep it. At least for as long as possible, as long as he can bear it. That is, as long as you can bear it, too."

"Basically a Levi x Reader but also kinda not (if that makes sense lol), it was just easier for this story to not use a Y/n. The twin sister of Eren Yeager follows her brother's story with a few extra twists and turns and, of course, a romance with Levi Ackerman. Now that I've really gotten into writing it I can say that this story contains: sibling fluff, angst, and some pretty major daddy issues. This story does not follow the AoT timeline fully and the character's ages are different. That being said, there is quite a big age gap between Levi and the reader or mc (whatever you want to call it). Although no romance will happen between them before she is 18. She does however have a romance before Levi that is pretty crucial to the story, this will happen before she is 18 though. Some parts of this story might need a TW, but I'll always put that before hand. There will be lemons later on in the story and mature themes throughout it. I do not own any of the AoT characters!"

"When you're selected to be the tribute representing District 12 in the 121st annual Hunger Games, you're pretty sure you're screwed. But, somehow, there's two things working in your favor. One: you're not half bad with a bow and arrow. Two: the male tribute from District 2 seems to have his eye on you..."
"Erwin is a little tired of hearing someone else's name."
"He crawls over to Jean and molds himself to the shape of his body and Jean can hardly breathe. He’s confused and scared and a little creeped out with the way that Armin is holding him but he decides that it’s better than him being left even though he knows that’s what should have happened. “We don’t have to tell anyone, I changed my mind. Just stay with me.” Armin’s voice is full of obsession and Jean rides the high of it even though he shouldn’t. He should tell Armin he’s insane and push him off but all he can do is hold onto him and breathe him in knowing if Armin left that he’d take his world with him. He refuses to lose someone again."
"The sun rises and the desolate land seems a bit brighter, even through Eren's disillusioned eyes. He has finally grasped the staggering yet irrefutable fact that Levi loves him, will be there for him, and wants to protect him. Though complicated, they are together, for better or worse. Everything was supposed to be okay. He just had to step outside for that smoke. But where there's smoke, there's always fire. And that lesson was a painful one to be learned."
"It took months for Jean to finally accept his best friend’s death. Then it took years for him to move on, if one could even say he ever really did. By the time he was nineteen, he liked to think he had healed as much as he could from such an event. He couldn’t have been more wrong. (inspired by @/yumafuki ‘s art on TikTok and Instagram)"

"The fourth suicide attempt was rough. It was his fourth with Armin and his first with Erwin. Afterwards when Erwin assured he would stay, was dedicated to helping Eren get and do better, Armin gave his stamp of approval. Eventually it just made sense for the smaller blonde to join their relationship. He called and texted Eren every hour, spent countless nights at their house anyways, came along to date nights. They’d been dating Armin long before they made it official."
"“....You ate her….” Grisha didn’t need the body to know that the mass pile of blood the child was sitting on that caked his skin and hair to know that it had been his test subject that was the vessel to his live experiment. Eren didn’t respond to him, he had a feeling Grisha had been expecting it for some time now. Grisha actually gave a little laugh when he stepped towards the boy kneeling before him as his gloved hands touched both of his blood soaked cheeks. “Splendid, child...Just splendid... The host has finally eaten its vessel ah, I wish I could have seen it in person..” The long haired male whispered in such a strange way that sounded foreign to Eren’s ear. ‘Does your depravity know no bounds, Father?’"
"After a devastating loss, Levi is left to grieve on his own. He shuts the world out, unwilling to open his heart to pain once again. His 21st birthday passes, declaring that he must participate in the Ritual of Fated Mates, but an unheard-of discovery leaves the pack in shock, including himself. This discovery may have shut the door to his foretold future, but when a door shuts..."

"Historia clucks her tongue, high as a kite. “What’s it like? To be Humanity’s strongest? Do they rip your heart out in the process?” “Do you feel anything anymore, Mikasa?” Then, softer- “I could help you feel something.” A feverish whisper. An offer."
"Jean hadn't gone to see Marco in ages, it just hurt to much going. Being forced to look into the face of what could have been, and yet here he was flowers clutched tightly in his hands trying to find the way to voice all the feelings he wished he could say."

"Armin has to do a chemistry project and suddenly gets asked by his crush, Jean Kirstein, to be his project partner, but they haven't EVER said a word to each other before. Armin keeps on wondering why Jean would ask him of all people to be his project partner and not his best friend, Marco. Does Jean like Armin the way Armin likes Jean or does Jean just want a good grade?"
"After his high school sweetheart has passed away, Jean had to finally get himself together and move on with his life one day. When a few months later he realized he was slowly falling for his best friend, not fully processed grief and guilt began to show up and remained present for a long time."
"Eren is the alpha prince of a small country, but with both his parents dead, the young man was appointed a regent for the past few years due to his age. Now he is 20, and ready to take over his kingdom. But in order for that to happen he has to take an omega and complete the mating ritual. Rod Reiss, his regent, seems more than happy to give over control to the prince, but underneath that facade he is scheming away to make it so that he continues to have control over the capital. Levi is an omega who basically grew up with Eren. His uncle, Kenny, ran one of the most prestigious omega houses in the country and had a close relationship with Rod. So Levi was often at the castle, until he presented as an omega that is. Once he did, Kenny locked him in a room, never to be touched. Now about 10 years later, he is being presented to Eren as his mate, but how far will rod go to secure his place on the throne."

"All it took for your life to turn around was a simple post. A few words, along with a photo. With this came along the pain, suffering, and death as if it were a package deal, but in all the negativity comes the positive, a fine balance, if you will. How does one find joy, peace, and happiness in this warped world of the unknown? And better yet, you might even boast about having the craziest love story. This is your story to tell, Y/N.

"He stared straight ahead, donning an expression you had never seen on him before. His body shuddered as he breathed. His eyes were unfocused. Sweat trickled down his face, crossing his temples and cheekbones, but not quite reaching his jaw. He looked like a damned man."

"I can’t say when I first fell in love with Levi. But once I knew I wished I had more time. A small one-shot when  Erwin looks back on his time in the Survey corps with Levi."
"“Do you not hate her?” Erwin asks. “I do,” Levi answers. “I hate her with the very essence of my being.” “Then why do you kneel for her?” He lifts his head. The words crumble to ash upon his tongue. ""Because she's the only thing I have left."" --- Childhood friends. Hah. The closest Levi has had to a childhood anything is that little bitch he has the misfortune of calling a childhood enemy. For a decade he has hated her, and for that decade they have clashed. But soon, that decades-long feud draws to a head when, in the true spirit of “paybacks a bitch”, Levi impulsively drags her into the scouts. A shit move, but hey, alls fair in love and war, right? Thrown out of the sewage, they’re forced to work together to survive, or at least, they would be if she wasn't a little too intent on killing him. But, when they are thrust into the light, there are creatures crawling out of the woodwork, conspiracies awoken from slumber. And they will soon prove to be fatal to those who do not belong. HELLO. HAVE AN ASIAN OC."
"You’re gravely injured during an expedition that goes wrong, and in the confusion you’re abandoned in Titan territory. Everything had been going far too well, so it only makes sense that when you’re reaching record breaking distances beyond Wall Rose that it all goes to shit. Could you blame them really? Leaving you behind? Assessing the sharp point of your femur poking through your thigh you decide, yeah, you could blame them a little. The question now is how you’re going to get back to blame them in person. Or rather, how you’re going to survive long enough to try."
"“They thought my death would save them,” she says softly. He holds her tighter. “Their lives aren’t worth yours.”"
"Again and again, he witnesses the memories tearing him apart. Again and again Levi’s there, to piece him back together."
"Monsters should never be found."
"you wanted to say it back. you really wanted to say it back. it was at the tip of your tongue. but maybe God forbids you... or maybe it was you who was forbidding yourself."
"Hitch Dreyse’s life has always been blank and colorless. Ever since she remembers, Hitch sees the world in black and white, which has forced her to grow up with a sense of apathy, in line with the ugliness of that reality. She doesn’t care about the boring grayness surrounding her. However, things start to change when the odd, fellow comrade Marlo Freudenberg enters her life. Soulmate What If. Not an AU – they are still in the Military Police."
"Eren wakes up Armin one night after returning from the battle at Marley."
"The night before Shiganshina, the middle of the battle, and the aftermath. Levi would follow Erwin anywhere - meaning the choice to let him go where Levi cannot yet follow is the hardest battle of all."
"“It’s just…as soon as I’m done and you have to go home…I’m right back out there again, begging for spare change in the cold. I never should have followed you in here; it will just make it harder to go back.” “Who said anything about leaving you out there again?”"
"She wondered and she waited for Marlo's return so she could say the one thing she wished she could have said before he left."
"They are bound by blood, but there always has been this distance between them - a space that neither of them could ever fill - didn't know how - didn't know where to begin even"

"Eren and Levi are worlds apart, and yet, they've formed a bond over their longing for freedom—from their oppressive lives in District 12 and the Captiol. That bond, however, is threatened when the 50th annual Quarter Quell changes the rules, putting both Eren and Levi at risk of being reaped. With all of Panem watching, will their bond come to flourish? Or will it break under the pressure of the Games?"
"A blind date can go very wrong... or maybe not so much. A match on Tinder could start a really intriguing story, or be the headline of a tragedy in the news. There are a lot of things that happen at night, some good, some... not so much. I have many stories to tell you and I'm pretty sure you'll love this one. It starts right off with a date via Tinder, cliché don't you think? But then it becomes very... interesting... Come with me and I'll tell you. Never before has the phrase: ""The night as our witness"" been used so appropriately."

"Historia plays her music- even after the ones she loves are gone."
"The world is cruel, but it is also beautiful. This is a lesson Faye Jeager learnt from a young age, and one she strives to teach to what is left of humanity. Faye’s fascination with the birds that flew over the walls of her small part of the world had her mesmerised since birth and served as the drive she needed to make it as a leader of a secret underground society. For a while, serving justice from the shadows was enough. But in a world as fragile as this, change can be brought about by a mere grain of sand. The fall of wall Maria would eventually bring death to what remained of humanity. Faye’s last promise to her mother was to keep Eren safe, even if it meant following him to the ends of the earth. What will Faye discover about herself, humanity and the Titans that plague the walls? Will she one day be able to spread her wings and fly, or will she fall like all the rest? See the world of Attack on Titan through new eyes as the return of the goddess threatens to change everything."
"Levi was sick of it, and he was so fucking tired. But they had to shoulder it all and move forward. So that, somewhere, in the end, it would be all worth it; every single death, broken bones and squashed bodies, grief and anger, and endless tears. That, and Levi had made a promise. - Both Levi and Hange mourn their fallen friends and comrades."
"Historia plays on... even after the death of her partner. Somehow, she still isn't alone."
"After the mission in the underground’s, you quickly realized there was more than what met the eye. The sudden death of Furlan and Isable was the breaking point of your sanity, leaving you a choice that you would forever regret. After your supposed Death at 21, the news was filled with terror about the 23rd Exterior scouting mission, it won the Title for the most casualties the scouts have faced leaving Commander Shadis handing his Title down to Erwin Smith as he couldn't bare the number of deaths on his name. Levi quickly made his way up the ranks within the 3 years, becoming the new captain of your old special operation squad. After the 3 years, you decided it was finally time to resurface from the undergrounds after finishing up your dirty work. You changed your identity leaving no residue from your past however you had a plan to rejoin the scouts under a different name but in order for that to happen you had to enlist into the 104th Cadet training corp. Eren and you were both placed under the supervision of Levi and his squad, however Levi’s attitude towards you quickly revealed the heart aching truth. But… There was an even bigger mystery…"
"Levi convinces Erwin to let him be the one to go."
"“Eren come, lie next to me.” You pat to the empty space next to you. The thunder was harsh and the rain heavy. He sits on the edge of the bed, back towards you. You move closer and rest your head on his shoulder. “What’s wrong?” you whisper. He lifts his head and gazes at the window. The room was dark, the only source of light being the occasional bolt of electricity. “Sometimes….” “Sometimes?” you lift the bottom of his shirt, tracing his back with light and gentle touches. He sighs and leans his head back, his hair brushing your face. He still wasn’t looking at you. You kiss his shoulder. “Eren look at me and tell me what’s wrong.” He turns his body, facing you. “Y/N.” You move to speak but he puts a finger on your mouth silencing you. “I wish I had never married you.”"
"Annie hears of rumors about a devil, a man, something in between the two worlds, and in the legends she finds a glimpse of retribution. (For Day 4 of Ereannie Week 2022 on tumblr: Horror / Romance)"
"“Erwin and Levi were the only two “Island Devils” held captive in Marley, so they were both subjected to lots of hate, but Levi more so. Not only was he an Island Devil, he was an Ackerman. Erwin was sometimes spared from some of the more violent treatment because of his disability, but Levi was subjected to double. In order to beat him down, the Marleyans (and even some of their fellow Eldians) manipulated him, isolated him, tried to get him to hate both Erwin and himself. They called him a dog. According to them, none of his choices were truly his own. Every breath he drew was in order to please Erwin. “You really think he actually cares about you? You’re the most miserable dick I’ve ever met; he’s obviously just using you, and there’s nothing you can do about it. I almost feel bad for you. Tell me, Ackerman, how does it feel to spend your entire life living as another man’s bitch?” Levi and Erwin were both captured during the return to Shiganshina. They have spent the last four years as prisoners of war in Marley."
"The frigid and unforgiving streets of the city were never a proper place for any person to grieve. The only solace she could find was within the tune of plucking strings. Those were the only moments she could escape the harrowing world around her. Each song, each note, made her long to leave her current reality. The deluge of a bizarre rainstorm would soon grant those endless wishes an opportunity; amongst giants and walls. Could this new life, in a new world, be the blinding light in her darkest tunnel?"
"Armin and Ymir have a conversation."
"Two things in life for you were for certain: One: You loved art in all of its forms. Two: Levi Ackerman was/is your best friend. Sounds simple enough right?"
"OC/Reader has known Levi since their trainee days, and she desperately tries to fight for a world where he doesn't have to lose anymore."
"“Well, if you get cold, let me know.” The words hung in the air between them and Jean nodded even though he was not certain he heard Marco correctly. Let him know? What exactly would Marco do in the event that Jean was too cold? Jean’s fists dug into the fabric of the tent floor. He wanted to hear Marco say what he was implying. Wanted to hear him say that he would use his body heat to warm him. The physical closeness that would require made Jean’s stomach hurt. Under no circumstances would he admit he was cold, no matter what. He would absolutely make a fool of himself, he was certain."
"And really, the game wasn't in Jean's interest at all. He had been dragged by his friends to this stupid place where he was doomed to an eternity of obnoxious hormonal teenage girls and greasy fast food that smelled awful. He could swear nothing caught his eye, not even the flustered lanky boy with pitch black hair and flushed cheeks that accentuated the brownish freckles scattered over his face. Well, maybe that wasn't totally true. Or the one in where Jean meets Marco at a football game and has a hard time trying to convice his friends (and himself) that he is straight, even though he knows he's balls deep. Pun intended."
"Annie Leonhart, a female pilot, starts an unexpected friendship with a flight attendant named Hitch Dreyse. Little do they know what will become of their friendship as they fly through a life of travel, lust, and love."
"hello! this is a collection of the stuff i post on tumblr! i started this thing where i look at the clock and write a (not very) short drabble about what levi and reader could be doing right now, then i decided to make all of them connected by the same timeline, so basically all of those drabbles are happening in the same life time just not in order. this is my way of trying to let out some of the love i have for this man, so if i get too deep, that only means that i love him this much. pls enjoy!!"
"If the days were bad, the nights were even worse. Levi’s Eren-mania bled into the dark of his room as the image of Eren crept into his unwilling mind. He was haunted by the memory of Eren looking at him so desperately that night, as if all he’d ever wanted was to be close to Levi… When Eren confesses his love to Captain Levi, Levi is unsure how he feels back but is determined to make sure it doesn’t go any further for Eren’s protection. Eren retaliates in a way Levi never expected."
"The murders of the children were far from myth, and yet few chose to believe them... Until the fateful day a child was bitten in the head and forced to get a transplant. With the grief of his childhood friend's injuries, Jean vowed to return to the restaurant and see what mysteries the place might hold...

"(On going) The war took its toll on humanity's strongest soldier. It took him apart and broke him down. With the newly structured government's program to rebuild and repopulate Paradis into a better and stronger nation, you are now to be married to Levi Ackerman, humanity's fallen soldier."
"Eren Jaeger had always been the louder and more talkative one out of the pair, and being the hotheaded and stubborn man that he was, this trait would occasionally lead to fights between him and his partner, Levi. That was alright, though, because the said fights had never actually caused any permanent damage to their relationship. Given this, they didn't think it was possible that one of their fights would catalyse an incident that would change them forever. That is, of course, until it did."
"Levi hates silence. Rated T for brief description of violence."
"Erwin is everything Levi has ever wanted to be.  And perhaps that’s why he fell in love with him. ☀️ In which King Erwin has waged war and taken kingdoms and brought his army and his loyal men far from home, and Levi, his right hand man, is losing his faith. Or, the AU inspired by Alexander the Great that no one asked for."
"King Levi Ackerman of Paradis holds little to no interest in anyone or anything which doesn't pose a direct threat to his country. That is until you, the Demon Tsar of Dimovka, propose an arranged marriage between yourself and Levi's adopted brother in order to adjoin the two countries in a lasting peace treaty (and to weasel your way into overthrowing another country he suspects). After that, Levi is much more interested in the empire of Dimovka, a certain infamous Imperator who rules over it, and ending the arranged marriage before you can sink your teeth into his country."
"She’ll stay tonight. For the first time, she’ll stay with me. The world was cold and cruel, a fact you were well accustomed to, and it was rare to find moments of solace. But with her around, it felt like that’s all the world would ever offer. Warmth and solace. You couldn’t stop the large grin that crept its way onto your face, absentmindedly drawing circles on her shoulder as you focused on the sounds of your breaths coming into sync. Though that didn’t last, as she eventually untangled herself to slowly make her way off the bed. You found your mouth clamped shut, the spring flowers once-blooming in your chest now withered away as your false hope was revealed to be nothing but that; false hope."
"Word spreads like wildfire among the staff at Scout Elementary that they will be getting a new colleague any day now. The position is FINALLY going to be filled after Nifa left last year. The speculation and gossip carries on for weeks as no one knows when this new mystery teacher will arrive. For one History Teacher in particular this new Kindergarten Teacher will be the change in his life he didn't know he needed."
"If there was one thing Jean Kirschtein had learnt from his years spent on the Scouts, was when to resign an already lost battle. As stubborn as he was. And so that morning, when he woke up next to Pieck Finger, he was sure: Everything had changed. Nothing would ever be the same. Or, being back in Paradis resurfaces the pain from long lost memories and, in the midst of the night, all Jean can do is seek for comfort in his once mortal enemy."
"The trip to Marley opens a floodgate of new opportunities for the remaining Survey Corps members to explore with Hange being an especially eager visitor to appease.  Hoping to familiarize them with the foreign technology, Onyankapon introduces his Paradian companions to the invention of the record player.  Caught up in its demonstration, the two remaining veterans are reminded of an old song thought to be long forgotten from their earlier soldier days.  Levi specifically discovers that music has a way with stirring buried emotions."
"Levi shuddered and wrapped his arms around himself, fighting for some shred of control to contain his emotions, to reschool his face into emptiness. It didn't work, it couldn't. He was too far gone, too far over the edge to possibly climb back up. Warm hands touched his elbows and he flinched away from the touch, eyes clenching tighter. ""Just hit me, beat me, h-hate me. Make it easy for me to hate you, to stop loving you."""
"The world is never fair. I have been dragged through years and years of shit. The underground. Thugs. Titans. For so long I thought I'd had it the worst. Been through the worst. Survived the worst. Then I met Eren Jaeger."
"The loss of light in the colder months isn't the only darkness Levi must contend with this time of year."
"This is loosely based off the song Arcade by Duncan Laurence. The story takes place in season 3 after the fight with the Beast Titan and how emotions are running high. Just a quick piece because I was feeling angsty."
"Eren understands what it's like to come from a toxic situation. Ever the loving partner, he's going to keep you safe from everything that comes your way - even if it's your own family."
"Here my prompts for pikuhan week 2022 in august. I post fanart as well as fanfics!"
"Bertholdt is tired of people leaving him behind."
"1. WarHammerTitan Mikasa She was a traitor just like the rest of them, so why wasn't he turning her in to his superiors in while his comrades searched for her all over the base. Why was he listening to her words and letting her get closer and touching her warm skin. The others, he'd raged at, had pledge to them he'd be their deaths. Why couldn't Eren immediately burn this bridge with Mikasa in the same way he'd done with Annie, Reiner, and Bertoldht. There were all fucking traitors. Remember that time I opened my request box? I'm finally getting around to writing them."
"❝Sasha has always kept her promises to you but sometimes not all promises can be kept.❞"
"Short story set in the Attack on Titan original universe, telling stories of Levi and Erwin's relationship and all their first experiences together. It's mostly closely connected chapters with some bigger time jumps, focusing on key moments of eruri relationship, discovering their likes and feelings and adjusting to being honest with themselves for liking each other."
"Make this a cruel dream, Eren begs. Don’t make this reality, I’ve lost too much, I only have so much to lose now; please, please…"
"The visions of him . . . his tremors in the Force have only grown stronger. Mikasa, Mikasa, Mikasa, his mouth chants over and over again as the bloodshine glow passes over him. That word means something, and she decides right there that before she kills him, she’s going to ask him what. /// Or, plagued by visions of a strange Jedi and spurred on by a Dark Lord of the Sith, Mikasa hunts the truth."
"Levi faces the final straw in his failing relationship with Erwin. a full fic based off this is in the works yall 😈😈"
"Eren's been working at the same nursery for two summers now. It's his happy place, especially since the guy he's been pining over (Levi) is probably with someone else. It's all good for a little while until he meets his new co-worker, the one person he did not want to see."
"We all know the story, it’s been told to us countless times. Eren and Mikasa run away to a beautiful cabin in the woods in order to enjoy a perfect romance. Of course, that’s nothing but a pipe dream. The truth is, Eren could never run away and it’s nobody’s fault but his own."
"Bertholdt still remembers the story clear as day. He must prevent its reenactment."
"After a breakup, Armin is far from ever wanting to date any time.  He just wants something easy, fun, with no strings attached to distract him from not being boyfriend material.  Thankfully, Jean feels the same. Still feeling down about his own recent breakup, and constantly scrolling through Marco's happy Instagram, Jean thinks that just having fun will help him to get over his ex. Under the one condition that neither of them develop feelings.  What's the worst that can happen? *Friends with benefits Jearmin, updates on Fridays!*"
"A collection of various one shots based on the prompt of the day"
"Bertholdt is dead. Except maybe he's not. Drabble. #ReibertWeek2022"
"Reiner lets Bertholdt comfort him, despite his thoughts."
"For Levi, trying to punch Erwin in the face was some sort of sick attempt at relieving his pain. He was asking for a punishment, and would gratefully accept it. For Erwin, it sparks an arousal that he knows isn't allowed under their professional requirements. It's only a matter of time before everything spirals far out of their control."
"Levi visits the brothel he once lived in, finally confronting the death of his mother."
"Modern!Au where Marco spends his last moments with Jean after a fatal accident. Despite doing that, despite all the memories, both Jean and Marco regretted not doing things they wanted to."
"Eren would love nothing more than to announce to the whole world that he loved Levi Ackerman with all his heart. But he knew they lived in a time, in which their love was forbidden and considered a crime. Levi and Eren shared a passionate love full of feelings and longing that could, however, get them both behind bars or lead to their deaths. Why was this world so cruel to people who were only in love with each other?"
"Sometimes. Every once in a while. Armin finds himself wondering what Annie would've been like if none of this had happened."
"He’s gorgeous, you’ve always thought so. You touch his cheek with your hand, and he looks up. Tears are streaming down his face; his eyes are red and puffy. Your heart aches for him and you want to hold him. You want to whisper in his ear and tell him it’s going to be okay. You want — ~ Or the one where Levi watches Eren cry (and more)."
"Marley taught them how to kill people and regenerate missing body parts. Marley tutored them on how to become a ruthless murder machine. Marley instructed them to abandon their humanity and carry new wild nature. Marley, however, hasn't told them how to keep their mind together and don't let the trauma take over them. Bertholdt tried, but maybe he wasn't all that strong besides mastering the Colossal Titan instantly."
"Though the crystal was searing hot to those around him, Bertholdt wasn’t uncomfortable. The inside was gentle and warm, not unlike being wrapped up by a cozy blanket. Nights spent in the bunkhouse snuggled up with Reiner crossed his mind before he slipped off to a deep rest. (During RtS, Reiner and Bertholdt crystallize themselves to save their own lives) (Day 2 of Reibert Week - Canon AU)"
"Levi comes to Erwin for comfort after a long day and Erwin's guilt over Furlan and Isabel's deaths comes to light."
"“He’s crazy about you, and I get it. You’re not that girl that somebody wants to lose.” When you started your new life at college, you hoped it wasn't as bad as your life back in high school. You were in a stable relationship with Jean Kirstein, had your whole life set out in front of you, and were a changed person. But when you find out that Eren Yeager used to go to school with you and knows about everything that happened, it changed your whole plan of how you thought your life would turn out. The real question though was: would it change for the better, or for the worst?"
"Levi let his gaze linger on the engagement ring before finally pulling it off his finger and laying it down on the table. He closed his eyes and felt a single tear slip from the corner of his eye. ""Goodbye, Eren."" - A story about Beta Levi and Alpha Eren, who aren't soulmates and have a relationship that society doesn't approve of. Despite this, they still want to give their love a chance, but what happens when Eren meets his true soulmate?"
"Mikasa and Eren made it through the hardest years of their life together. Mikasa and Eren triumphed together. Mikasa and Eren are there to pick each other up when they fall. It's always been Mikasa and Eren, Eren and Mikasa; but at the same time, it's not. Mikasa and Eren might not have a future together, and as much as she tells herself it's okay, it still hurts like hell."
"A few very short drabbles based on five word prompts that I accepted a while back <3"
"Based on Champagne Problems by Taylor Swift and this is the man's perspective. That's all."
"It's been years. No matter how many, Reiner still remembers, still feels guilt pooling deep in his chest. It doesn't matter now."
"Living a life of luxury, you had never expected your world to be overturned in one night; in just a few hours. From a life filled with balls; extravagant evenings and people falling to their knees at the sound of a mere word to having it all swept from under your feet. You’re torn away from your world and left to struggle through a world you’ve never seen before: he takes you away from everything. But he doesn’t just steal you away. He takes you on a journey you never would have had in your world."
"They weren't afraid of the other being disloyal. When Bertholdt left, getting into the carriage and smiling at Reiner from the window oh-so-gently, Braun trusted that even his lover's career could never defeat their devotion. Although, he hasn't questioned how dedicated he could be and how long he could stay independent from his mother's choices."
"As a soldier, Reiner can say he's seen his fair share of atrocities while on duty. He just didn't expect to come home from deployment to the worst one of all; some mysterious virus that had appeared out of nowhere and swept away nearly everything in its path. Now, he roams the ill-named country of Paradis alone, bitter and guarded. After all, there's not much worth fighting for in this ruined world, aside from his own survival and the need for revenge that keeps him going. But maybe that can change. Maybe."
"Wall Maria has just been regained and Eren is feeling fine. After reading the books, finding out about Marley, his father, and his brother. It's all fine. Or so he's fooled himself to believe so. Or, Eren breaks down and Levi is there to help pick up the pieces."

"Seventeen-year-old Jean Kirschtein complains about life, his best friends use him for his car, all the normal high school stuff. It sucks. Being seventeen really, really sucks. Especially when your best friends make you come to a stupid football game. Especially when you see Eren and his hot adopted sister there. Especially when you're starving and go to the food stands, and-- Wow, that guy has a lot of freckles."
"they say absence makes the heart grow fonder. apparently, they were right. they were right because it's been five years since armin last spent a summer with eren. they were right because it's been five years and armin's heart still beats a little faster whenever eren's around. but he can't get attached; he has a degree to earn, a career to pursue, and thousands of miles between them when the summer ends. it's funny how the head and heart never seem to agree, isn't it?"
"Marco Bodt got into a car accident at the age of 16, which resulted in him losing his right arm. Convinced that none of his friends care about him, he moved to another town and learnt to adjust to his new reality. Jean Kirschtein spent the past 2 years in conviction that his best friend wanted nothing to do with him and trying to get used to that. At the age of 19 he thought he'd moved on. Or maybe he just hoped he had. They reunite in college, and it turns both of their seemingly peaceful lives upside down."
"The events at Liberio has left Porco feeling emotionally distraught and physically sick. Riddled with nightmares and plagued with Guilt, Porco begins to struggle through his daily life. With the day to leave for Paradis approaching worryingly fast, can his closest friend and his worst enemy bring him back to his old self again in time for their departure? Basically 4 chapters of angst, hurt comfort and a deep delve into Porco and how much trauma he had to deal with after Eren used him to retrieve the Warhammer. Idk how to write summaries but I promise the story is worth reading :')"
"Dealing with shitty hand that life dealt you is not always sunshine and rainbows. Sometimes you've got to see it for what it is. Shitty."
"!! SEASON 4 AOT SPOILERS !! In the wake of Sasha Blouse's death, grief consumes the reader's waking mind. Caught between wanting to be near her and not knowing how to do so, the reader struggles to get a handle on life going forward while wanting to remain in the past."
"When Erwin Smith yet again brings in an Underground gang, Levi isn't expecting to see one person - you. But there you are, tougher, more cynical, more capable, and with a far more violent gang leader than Levi ever was as your best friend and FWB. Levi wants to apologise, and he wants the love of his life back, but with you pretending you've never met him before, how on earth is he supposed to remind you of how in love the two of you were and win you back from the idiot you arrived with?"
"A final letter to Levi Ackermann, Humanity's Strongest Soldier. From, Eren. But it didn't reach Levi. Or Small Epistolary of Eren before he did the Rumbling (timeline isn't specified.)"
"He’s always been ready to sacrifice himself. Eren thinks of himself as no coward, but he is no hero either. He’s done his part, he knows, but as usual it’s never been enough. At least he will get to choose how he dies."
"For seven years, Eren Yeager has dreams of the future involving his superior officer, Captain Levi. As each year passes, dark events keep unfolding and Eren is no longer sure he can wait for the Titan War to end. One day, he asks something of Levi that changes everything between them."
"The war between the Eldian people and everyone could never end well. The Eldian's won but now they have to deal with the fallout from the war. Things might never be the same for some, it's as it always was for others. It takes time to heal. ~~~~~ Updates every week on Friday :))))"
"“It’s always been in you, this thing, this pathetic fucking parasite. This need for violence. You could do something great with it, if it doesn’t kill you first. It’s why you’re no one. It’s why you’re always cold. I bet it’s warm now though, huh? A hot bath after a long day. But don’t mistake it for love. Not for a second. It isn’t love. It’s our chains.” There’s a new gang threatening the Rippers’ monopoly on illegal weapons dealing, growing like a tumour in London’s financial heart. Levi, the Rippers’ strongest weapon, is given a simple task: cut the head off the opposition; kill their leader, Erwin Smith. Dark Ackerbond organised crime AU."
"Levi has always been a private and withdrawn man, his life having been dedicated to service in the military.  The quiet afterward is unsettling and driven by a whim and curiosity, Levi goes into a facility for recovering Omega. He never thought he would meet one of his subordinates within, pronounced lost by his regiment.  Despite everything, the Alpha can't stop thinking about Eren Yeager and just how well he could take care of the Omega. He can't stop thinking about making a happy life for the both of them. --------------------- *Please feel free to translate this work or make fanart for this story, you don't need my permission for that!

"Captain Jean Kirstein has been sailing all his life. But even the most experienced sailor can't outsmart the majestic force of the ocean. As his ship runs aground, Jean doesn't realize it's the least of his worries when there's a curious creature lurking from the pitch-black depth of the water. ~ There are things humans and sirens don’t know. When the sea answers to the moon, it follows the call of its mate; it dances to its tune."
"Hange glanced over at Pieck, watching her grey eyes sparkle after every sip of coffee, how her slightly unkempt raven-coloured hair fell down her shoulders. Hange was enamoured of her. It’s because of Pieck that when Hange wakes in the morning, they can wind their spring and tell themselves to live another good day. Hange would never leave her. They would be like this, forever, for as long as time would allow it."
"It's the year 844. You're putting your medical expertise to use wherever it's requested within the Walls, often leaving your residence in Trost to venture to new opportunities. On one volunteer trip to assist the Scouts after an expedition, you come to learn about the mysterious survivor of Flagon's section. His strength intrigues you, and your curiosity spurs you to follow him right into the daunting jaws of the Scout Regiment."
"""I know it'll be a bunch of stupid words..."" Levi decides to read the diary of someone he definitely does not care about. T/W: HAS LOTS OF TRIGGERING TOPICS!!!! Read at your own risk. This is filled with fictitious characters from the anime and manga series attack on titan. It may contain spoilers of the series, as some segments are/may be based on canon events. But there is an OC, so it doesn't prioritise the main story of attack on titan."
"“You need me,” he had argued, crossing his arms over his chest. “Don’t be stupid, Erwin. You will die out there without me, and we need you here alive and well.” I need you. Please don’t go where I can’t protect you he didn’t say, but he had a feeling Erwin heard it anyway."
"The aftermath of it all was something Eren knew he was never ready to handle. It's so much easier to sanction his cruel actions all alone. He's come back, but it hardly remedies the irreparable damage that's already been done. After it all he still can't be honest, he thinks the truth might kill him, even though it already feels like he's dying a slow, painful death. It's better this way, isn't it? That he's the only one who gets hurt? But he's not the only one. That's the problem."
"After an unfortunate chain of events during a very important job, Armin finds himself trapped in limbo. However, he thinks limbo has become his reality. He's convinced that Eren is dead and the job was a failure. Jean comes into limbo to try and save him. (INCEPTION AU)"
"In a world where most of humanity had retreated and hid in the safety of the Walls, Titans reign supreme. But unbeknownst to the people of the Walls, there are threats and creatures lying beyond the horizon far greater than the monsters scraching at their doorstep. Many miles away from their secure gates, there are beings whose mere existance is incomprehensible to their limited knowledge and one-dimentional mindset. Creatures that could easily put humanity to the test or be it's most valued allies that could finally turn the tide in their three-centuries-long war. When their safe-heaven is inevitably destroyed and the world is once again plunged into hell by the creatures' might, it is also up to them to end the cycle and return the world into the peace it had lost on the day the first Titan appeared. Or Eren is Titan shifter living his life and minding his own business outside the Walls. Until one day he somehow gets cought up in a war he never wanted to be apart of and might just be what humanity needs to end this unfortunate conflict. I'm bad at summaries"
"When Eren chooses to separate himself from Levi, he faces the wastelands alone. Between a nuclear winter, mutant creatures, ghouls, and a lack of food and resources, Eren's chances of survival are slim. Will he be able to endure the cruelty of this world? Or stumble and fall? A spin-off of As the World Caves In (Do not read if haven't read up to chapter 31.)"
"Sometimes the hardest realisation can be that the actions that were taken, logical and justified, are the actions that can plague us with the most guilt. When fully faced with the consequences of his actions, Armin begins to doubt the choices that led him here, and he finds that sometimes even the slightest clearing of conscience is underserved. Aruani Week Day 1 - Angst Prompt: Monsters."
"Day 4 and 7: Soulmates and Fireflies Gone , Eren’s mind would cry, his distress like the flares they shot up into the sky, made of black and greens and reds that hurt Levi’s soul. Always gone. Levi would do his best to soothe him, running fingers through the damp strands of Eren’s hair and holding him close. He would wrap his body around the other male as he did with his mind, enveloping him in calming blues and grays that Eren lit up like fireworks in his distress. It would hurt, sending pain radiating out through Levi’s very being as he was invaded with emotion too strong and uncontrolled to be anything else. He would endure it though, because there were far worse things that could happen to him--to them--than a little pain. I’m here, he would croon, thoughts like a soft melody. Nothing is gone."
"Post-Marley Levi reminisces about pre-Marley Eren. And he yearns, misses, wants. Prompt: No backspace button. No changing sentences. Only typo editing is allowed. Another Prompt Challenge from the Attack on Writing Discord Server ."
"It’s still Eren, repeating his name in Mikasa's head, even when Eren doesn’t write his name in his letters. Hiding his name from foreign eyes, even worse, maybe Marleyans who trusted him. She wants to close the curtains and drop her face into her hands, to just let her accept their predicament for a few nights, with only the scent of her wooden desk grounding her to reality, instead of war correspondence from other people carried over by messengers. There’s a knock on her door. Mikasa looks out the peephole before stopping. It was dark, and surely no one in this building would try anything. Her fingers reach for the doorknob, before stepping back. “Armin,” Mikasa says, voice slightly higher than usual. “It’s late,”"
"Love blossoms, and thrives, and withers, and dies - and time stops for none of it. Annie Leonhart knew that marrying Armin Arlert was the right choice. She never doubted it. She still doesn't, not even when the cracks begin to form and their marriage begins to shatter under the weight of Armin's busy career. She never doubted her choice, not once...but she is starting to doubt if she's strong enough to endure the consequences of it. Feeling her slip away, Armin pleads for Annie to wait, to hold on a little while longer, to stay. Time stops for nothing, and Annie offers him a challenge in a final bid to save their marriage. ""Make me."" Aruani Week 2022 (Day 6 - Sacrifice)"
"Mikasa's mind kept going back to that fateful moment when the very same creepy-smiling titan that had devoured Carla Yeager five years ago was about to finish her and Eren. At that instant, she was convinced it was the end of the line. It had been then that she’d decided to pour her heart out to him, to not leave this world without letting him know how she truly felt about him … so why hadn’t she? And those bizarre dreams she had afterwards ...  if there was someone in this world that could bear with whatever lunacy had taken over her without judging her, it was Armin."
"“Merry Christmas, Mikasa. Good Luck.” He called out from across the park without sparing her a single glance. Mikasa should have got up and chased after him when she heard him speak again. Or maybe she should have done it when she heard his shit box of a car start, she shouldn’t have let him leave. But she did. She did let him leave. Frozen in place she mourned what could have been, mourning the overly ambitious daydreams where Eren supported her and stayed by her side. OR A Modern AU where Mikasa and Eren hook up at a high school party, Mikasa ends up pregnant and Eren’s immaturity on the matter destroys over a decade of friendship. Five years later Mikasa tries to move on while being a single mother and Eren tries to pretend that night with Mikasa never happened."
"Aruani Week 2022 | Day 2 – Jealousy/Pretend Armin never imagined Annie having a church wedding. Well, he never imagined Annie having a wedding at all, especially to someone who wasn’t him. But he chose to attend anyway, and now he's beginning to regret it."
"Collection of drabbles in various aus, fluff, smut, angst. Essentially just pouring my heart out into these two idiots in many versions of their relationship."

"There was always a fleeting moment before they began pummeling each other that made Jean feel something he couldn’t quantify. In the seconds between their directed insults and the feeling of bleeding knuckles was this curious transition, a glint between them that Jean didn’t bother to understand, and it walked a line between the definition of fury and the associated feeling of fervor. Jean had been in a lot of fights before; none of them had the charge of zeal that he felt when he was at his wit’s end with Eren. He felt it now. ------------------------- Set during the time where they're stationed along the coast, prior to contact with any outsiders, when Eren and Jean's rivalry brings them to a level neither of them is quite ready for."
"Day 3 prompt/s: Wrong Time “I loved you,” she said between tears, between sharp intakes of breaths. “No, not loved; I love you. And I can’t be your friend and watch you be happy with someone else.” “I loved you, too.” Annie looked back up at him to find him smiling a sad smile, and shaking his head. “I still love you, Annie.” It was her turn to shake her head and return that defeated smile. “Well, it doesn’t matter now, anyway. It doesn’t change anything."""
"After spending one fateful night in an abandoned cabin in the middle of nowhere, Levi and Eren's lives are drastically changed."
"“Erwin and Levi were the only two “Island Devils” held captive in Marley, so they were both subjected to lots of hate, but Levi more so. Not only was he an Island Devil, he was an Ackerman. Erwin was sometimes spared from some of the more violent treatment because of his disability, but Levi was subjected to double. In order to beat him down, the Marleyans (and even some of their fellow Eldians) manipulated him, isolated him, tried to get him to hate both Erwin and himself. They called him a dog. According to them, none of his choices were truly his own. Every breath he drew was in order to please Erwin. “You really think he actually cares about you? You’re the most miserable dick I’ve ever met; he’s obviously just using you, and there’s nothing you can do about it. I almost feel bad for you. Tell me, Ackerman, how does it feel to spend your entire life living as another man’s bitch?” Levi and Erwin were both captured during the return to Shiganshina. They have spent the last four years as prisoners of war in Marley."
"Historia is better than him."
"Levi Ackerman is Erwin Smith's weapon. And he loves and is loved. But he fails to be the perfect weapon and for that, he takes his punishment."
"Aruani Week 2022 | Day 5 – Nightmares She wants to stop him, to abandon whatever sense of self preservation she has and scream at him to run, to leave her, to make a break for it while he still can. But she knows she won’t. If there’s a self-sacrificial bone in her body, it’s one she’s broken."
"“I really do hate the way you say good person .”  Armin’s hand almost squirmed around Annie’s wrist as he began, thankful that she sat right back down instead of making another motion to leave.  Such a description felt misleading and inaccurate, and it made him nauseous that he couldn’t agree with it.  He had no doubt she still thought of him as who he was as a fresh member of the Survey Corps, and he had to correct that. On the boat ride to Odiha, Armin contemplates the path he took to be able to call himself a monster."
"Aruani Week 2022 | Day 5 ½ – Nightmares Nothing about this situation is good. Not this stupid, co-dependent friendship that hurts more than it helps and leaves her confused every time she sees him. Not the cigarette resting between her lips, primed for a light. All of it’s wrong, but she doesn’t do anything to stop it."
"Erwin is pregnant, Levi is not happy SEE TAGS FOR TWs!!!!!!!"
"Love didn’t need martyrs. History already had enough of those….. Hange rubbed at her arms, the adrenaline of the ODM gear wearing off bit by bit allowing the cold to seep into her already pale skin. ‘Oh.’ Silly her, she thought while she doubled over into a cough. She’d almost forgotten…. She was dying."
"I'm sorry, Jean. I can't do this. I'm not that woman. I can't be your wife. I can't be their mother. Don't worry about me. Don't come looking for me, please. I'm sorry."
"The war was over, but it left a million broken pieces in its wake."
"Set in the battle of Shiganshina, Bertholdt finds Reiner's headless body and fears it may be his last chance to be with Reiner. Without a single ounce of shame, he commits himself to Reiner once more."
"""Maybe things could have gone differently between us in another life."" You are an Eldian born and raised in Marley to become a warrior. Becoming one of the strongest warriors in the Eldian Warrior Unit, you were given the opportunity to become a titan inheritor, that is, until one mistake caused your family name to be completely tarnished. In order to redeem yourself and bring honor back to your family name, you were given one very important task... To kill Levi Ackerman."
"When the only person to see The Fuser’s ugly, scarred face on that night is an untamable, downright incorrigible omega named Eren, both Levi and Erwin must figure out just how they’re going to gain the trust of this mistreated welp and solve Trost’s biggest missing-persons case of the decade that threatens to go cold. Follow along as trouble and mischief ensues— Can Erwin and Levi trust the very people they work alongside, and will they be able to gain the help and companionship of the lonely, angry little omega that so threatens both their sanity, and restraint?"
"""He can feel Erwin’s gaze burning into him, can feel all of it, the confusion, the betrayal. “You’re lying,” Erwin spits back at Kenny, and the older man laughs again, Erwin’s playing right into his games. “Erwin I need you to be quiet,” Levi reiterates, still refusing to meet his eyes. “Now this is rich isn’t it? Honestly this exceeds my expectations,” Kenny purrs, that stupid fucking smirk back in place. “How much does he know, by the looks of it he doesn’t know anything about you!” Kenny pauses, scoffs, and then grins wickedly at Levi,  “I mean Jesus he’s still looking at you like you might save him, like you’re a human being,” Levi wishes Kenny would stop talking, his grip tightens around his gun and he knows its useless, Kenny’s fast, if he does anything stupid Erwin will die. It takes all the self restraint he has not to kill Kenny right then and there, knowing what comes next."" Ambiguous oneshot I wrote years ago. Kenny has taken Erwin hostage and Levi must face his past and the hard truths of his upbringing to save his life.  Weirdly poetic and I wanted to get it out there."
"Before we were born, I asked you to choose the color of my eyes. But our souls were young and they had never fallen on earth before. All we had seen up until then was the sky, so you chose blue for me. His words haunt her through life and death, over and over, coming back in shreds of memories and brief flashbacks, never sticking by enough for her to find him. But what if one day, upon the landscape of a monotone cafe, she manages to catch a glimpse of him?"
"Everyone at work knows that Levi Ackerman is getting married."
"Levi Ackerman is living alone attempting to recover from his past marriage to Erwin Smith and the death of his violent uncle, Kenny Ackerman. He likes his solitude and daily routine and enjoys the company of his dogs. Until his cousin comes to visit on spring break with friends, and that's when he meets Zeke Yeager, and Levi knows that cheeky grin and sarcastic tone is going to bring him trouble."
"A trip through your memories with Annie, leading up to the rumbling."
"Jean’s in an alleyway with his dealer, they both have on dark hoodies pulled up over their faces. Jean palms his cash, thrusts it forward for Bertholdt to count. He’s itching to get out of there, paranoia setting in thickly. He hasn’t called Marco and he’s ignored all of his messages. He’s tainted too many people in his day and he doesn’t want that nice stranger to be one of them."
"Relationships are certainly not the portrait of perfection. With their ups and downs, they sometimes resemble a rollercoaster of emotions. There will be tests life deals, whether naturally or at the fault of others. And for Jean and Floch, the fault lies with one of them. After a pattern of mysterious bruises, late nights, and unfamiliar scents, Floch has finally caught on to Jean's affair."
"It’s irrational, the way he loves him, but he’ll go mad with it. Lost in his own asylum, Levi's his sanctuary in a tumultuous world spinning out of control. He rocks with the waves and tumbles and falls and Levi’s always there to pick him back up, to nurse his humanity back to health. He sees the stars lining Eren’s eyes are fading. He sees his boy is fading. And Eren just wants to be good for him-for one last time. He wants him soft and sweet-or anyway Levi will have him. He wants to forget his destiny is doom. He wants to love even though he never learned how. And Levi’s lips are gently pressed against him and kissing up and down the hollow in his throat. When Levi’s drunk and his defenses are down and Eren wants to pretend, there's nothing they can do to stop the requiting of themselves."
"There was just something so pure about the way Eren slept, it was like watching clouds move along lazily through the clear sky. It was a memory Armin couldn't bear to lose. He remembers how Eren would mumble his name, how the words curved out of him slowly in sleep, the impact always the same for Armin. He’d reach out and trace patterns on the palm of Eren’s hand or he’d simply sit there in awe, that Eren could produce his name so perfectly. Eren had been so quiet in sleep when he spoke, almost like his words were for Armin alone. He collected them like they were, each one that escaped Eren added to his memories; branded into his skin."
"When the kidnappers came for Mikasa and her mother, her father disrupted their plan, stopping them at the cost of his own life. When the Titans breached the Wall Maria, two women managed to escape and rebuild their lives in another place. But a gruesome fate followed the raven girl, and she still ended up in the Underground a few years later, only this time it was her Ackerman abilities that were valuable to the abductors. As a result, she was forced to learn how to fight with the best trainer the Underground had."
"He wanted to cry out. He wanted to scream into the abyss of his emotions, but the only things he could feel were his shock and the tears running down his face. He could only focus on the lifeless corpse that looked like it had been through several brutalized homocides, and his world fading into black. Armin Arlert woke up in a cold sweat in his own bed. The time read exactly 12:28, and the day was August 14th.. just how it was before. Eren protected Armin from death for years in hopes of being free, and it’s about time Armin did the same."
"The weight of being Humanity's Last Hope crushes Eren, while all his failures cut him open and bleed him dry. In the frigid darkness, empty and numb, Eren has lost hope in himself, nearly giving up on everything. That is, until Humanity's Strongest shows up to lessen the weight."
"Pain is part of life. Pain is his companion, familiar and ever present. Except for the pain of shame and failure. But maybe that failure would be worth something after all."
"Levi wanted to kiss his lips and see his strong face one last time. Now all he has is his sketchbook filled with memories and fading faces."
"“When does it end, Eren?” Armin whispers. “Where do you draw the line?” “Why should it stop?” he growls. “Why must there be a line?” Why should it? A world that took her away from him— a world where she isn’t allowed to exist isn’t a world that deserves to continue. OR After losing Mikasa, Eren has gone mad with grief, hellbent on destroying whatever is left of the world. Only for her to turn up alive and made to become one of his wives. AKA The Warlord AU."
"Based on the prompt from a tag: “And there were TWO beds, but they fucked anyways.” After the raid on Liberio, Mikasa must cope with the fallout of losing one of her closest friends over the decisions Eren has made. While she struggles with her grief, an unlikely lifeline is given to her courtesy of a shortage in rooms."
"Historia is happy."
"The teen knew his best friend didn’t see him like that. After all, he saw how Armin looked at Jean, eyes bright and filled with wonder and adoration."
"Erwin looked tired, but in the kind of tiredness that was found in people from Underground. The kind that showed in slow moving limbs, in eyes that knew not how to look up, and in the haunting shadows of gaunt cheeks. On Erwin, it showed in the darkened skin and blue veins under his eyes, a product of the constant sleep deprivation he had endured over the years, sinking slowly into the layers of skin until they were visible signs that only made Erwin look more severe than he already did. And the lines on his forehead, on the edge of his eyes, around his mouth - they all reflected something troubling. A suffering beneath the skin."
"Growing up Eren had always been told what he was supposed to do and how he was supposed to feel. As a child he was incredibly outspoken and deemed himself as the type to ‘live according to his own rules’ but who is a boy who doesn’t listen to his own parents? He had always had it in the back of his mind that Mikasa (A girl, around the same age as him, whom his father had taken in when they were young) was the one he was to marry. He cared for her dearly and would protect her at all costs. Eren, Mikasa and another boy, named Armin, were very close. Armin was the boy across the street who’s known the other two for as long as they could all remember. Together they formed their own trio, a family of contrasting personalities thrown together by circumstance but they fit together well , similarly to pieces of a puzzle. But to eren something had always felt out of the place, he loved their dynamic, the energy all three of them emitted when they were together but as they grew older and him and mikasa grew closer more intimately, their dynamic shifted and the puzzle pieces eren once associated themselves with no longer fit together as they normally should."
"""The tree stands proud and majestic in the middle of the graveyard. Beautiful, and bloody eerie, too.

You two dated for a while during your second year, but it seemed that both your parental problems and the way it caused you to treat loved ones back in the day before you stopped hating everything about life damaged your relationship with him. He had maybe a thousand girlfriends on top of you, and you had your shared amount of partners, but it always seemed like he moved on easily. Then again, Eren always had masks, laughing and smirking on the outside, and he had always been too proud, and even if he still loved you as much as you loved him, he would never admit it to you, or himself for that matter.

"Levi and Eren have been together almost as long as Eren's been in the Survey Corps, but they're finally taking their relationship to the next level. Levi tries to be prepared; he isn't."
"Marco Bodt cries in his sleep. And Jean hates him all the more because he understands."
"Levi is a spy for the government, a trained killer and the best they have. He saves the world all the time, but nothing compares to the love of his life and wife to be. You are Levi's world, he'd do anything for you, even kill a person or make someone 'disappear.' You know that he's a spy, but you have to keep it secret from others which only makes it more exciting. After finally getting married, you and Levi go on a very long honeymoon only to find yourselves in the lap of a man who is a future mission for Levi. A chance encounter allows you to show your social skills and the ability to bullshit your way into things, mainly due to being the adviser to the mayor in your city, the scouts ask you to help Levi in his future missions. Fake identities, risky steals, car chases, old flames, people falling for you and more are faced you and Levi. The two of you rely on each other's strengths and love to work through it all. Who doesn't love a little spy romance?"
"“If I were to die,” Armin says, serious now, “I’d want to drown.” Jean tightens his grip on his own piece of bread so as not to drop it – when bread falls, it’s a sin, someone told him once, picking a baguette up and wiping the dust off with a sleeve – and thinks don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t you even dare. They were so stupid once, thinking they had wings."
"Eren is devastated to go home after spending an amazing Summer on the beach with Levi, so when it turns out his family is not leaving and Eren will be attending the same High School as Levi, it's like all of his dreams were coming true. But why is Levi acting so strange when others are around? Can the two of them figure out their differences and find a way to be together?"

"Eren has begun working at Rivaille Mansion to pay off his debts. Unfortunately the only available job was as a maid. Eren's new master has taken quite a liking to his new plaything, and Levi is determined to make Eren his at any cost. Smut in later chapters (Riren) Warning: things get pretty dark in middle chapters read at your own risk."

"Eremin week day 1: Seashell. The seashell reminds Armin of how things were back then."
"Eremin week day 3: Broken. Some of the times Eren and Armin felt broken and helped put each other back together again, and the one time nothing could."
"None"
"Levi has promised to kill Eren if he goes wild. Yet it would have been nice to spend more time with him."
"Reader finds out that Levi and Petra are dating and starts to feel a little jealousy. But maybe it’s not as it seems."
"He wondered who would find him first. Would it be Levi? He was sure it's his watch next. But then it might be Erwin. He likes to walk at night sometimes."
"What do you do when the love of your life vanishes?  Did he leave you?  Is he OK?  And worse ... what do you do when he comes back?"
"He finds her in the messhall, late at night, with a bottle in her hand."
"Eren's been living with an abusive Aunt since he was 9 years old but it's only now that people are staring to notice, particularly, his best friends brother, Levi. He doesn't know what it's like to live a normal life, doesn't remember what it feels like to have a family. He's broken in more ways than one but Levi is determined to show Eren the love he deserves."
"The name's Eren, proud alpha of a pack of six. Or rather, I was. Until this motherfucker shows up in my forest with the innocent words of ""Fuck you! This is is a public park, you bitch! It's not like you own it!"" And he was wrong if he thought I was going to go down without a fight. The song that inspired this fic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGLu_2uGRhk"
"In twitter I saw a post about a December dedicated to Levihan. Everyday in December we post arts, photos or driwings about Levihan. Every day has a different prompt. It's my first time doing something lke this, so it may not be perfect. The oneshots probably won't be connected, but who knows maybe some will contain references, I haven't made up my mind yet. All characters belong to Hajime Isayama."
"In a chaotic world of blood and tears, the emotions of Eren and Mikasa are always being tested to the limit. But there is a fact: no matter what kind of difficulty they have to go through, their feelings will always converge to each other."
"When love is a weakness that gets in the way of your goals, you should discard it."
"When he finally finds him, Eren doesn't remember, Levi does, and it hurts more than he can explain. To be so close yet so far away from him. He could reach out yet never cross the final distance between them. And even though Eren doesn't remember, Levi sees the past reflected in all the small things; in the brown of Eren's favorite belt, in his slight obsession with wing patterns, in the strong crave for freedom, in the way he unconsiously bites his hand out of frustration, in the perfect shade of green he is obsessed with, but mostly in the way Eren looks at him when he thinks he can't see him. Every little thing is a painful reminder that despite all that, Eren doesn't remember."
"Levi has survived in the Underground and fought Titans, not even feeling a hint of fear, but now, when he’s about to meet Erwin’s parents, he’s fucking terrified. Pathetic. He might be a great soldier, but what a shit of a person he is. or Levi muses about a few important moments of the past before going to meet Erwin's parents."
"After being in an abusive relationship for years, Levi is ready to start something new with his assistant, but forgetting about the past isn't always easy."
"If you had asked Eren where he saw himself in five years he definitely wouldn't have said screwing recently divorced grey men in their forties for a living. He always imagined he'd end up in business or something simple, or even an artist if he worked hard enough at it. But adulthood has a funny way of turning things on their head, and Eren certainly wasn't spending his days in a blissful office job. Life had certainly fucked him over with his demanding work hours, overcrowded apartment and shitty string of past relationships. Or relationship to be more precise. Eren's life opens up to the intricate world of art after meeting Levi, a short man with an even shorter temper. He finds himself living in a way he forgot existed and slowly begins to pick up his broken shards. But Eren knows how easy it is for something fragile to shatter once more."
"Christmas was the time of year where joy and festivities took over the city. For some, it was a peaceful time. For others, it was a chaotic time. But, there are those who can feel neither for what is Christmas without feeling warmth by your side. Some may go forever without the comfort of another. But, it is not a mandatory solace. Hanji wants to take that warmth to others, and for one man in particular, she wants to make it a memory."
"""The chocolates you gave that night helped."" ` levihancember twenty two/three - gift & chocolates"
"Never in a million years did Eren expect his squad to be killed like they were nothing. He blames their death on Annie. Because of her he has to suffer as does his captain. Through the dark times he and his captain are now faced with, perhaps each other's comfort is what could help them. What the boy didn't expect was to develop feelings along the way."
"Oneshot request for anonymous “All the way to the end, right?” “No. Not until the end. Always. Forever.”"
"Life is hard. But math is harder. So, when the new student struggles in class, Jean finds himself helping him, not knowing what it’ll lead to..."
"Eren used to believe that dancers needed music to enhance their moves and performance. But the days of seeing Levi move in complete silence allowed him to marvel at the pure finesse in each movement. And while now he can only see those movements again through a screen, he'll never forget the grace and ease in which the other male moved."
"When Levi starts needing a bit more money to pay rent, he starts looking for new jobs then lands an interesting babysitting job. He then meets Eren Yeager, a loaded, famous doctor in charge of several hospitals all over the districts. Immediately, they both find something interesting about the other and can’t seem to separate themselves from each other."
"What Levi and Erwin have isn't exclusive, and sometimes it bothers Erwin how much he wishes it was."
"It can break a young girl’s heart, to dream of things she cannot have."
"Hands tainted with colours of the soul are the same as those whose hands have been painted with the blood of another. In a world of magic and seniority two kingdoms lie across from each other, separated by two large walls marking their defence. But one day humanity received a grim reminder that they lived in fear of the titans- giant monsters revived from spirits or very powerful creatures that many called “shifters.” Legend has it that these shifters lived outside of the walls, hiding away and creating lives of their own but once these walls come crashing down all is lost and trust is scarcer than it had ever been before…"
"An emotional misunderstanding between them, inadvertently caused by Marco, forces Jean and Armin to realise and assess their feelings towards each other."
"His lips brushed against Eren's one last time and he opened his eyes. There he was, standing in front of him, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips. Eren felt his eyes widen and he reached out to touch the man he loved only to see his fingers slip through. He drew his hand back as he stared at him, blinking back tears .. The man's expression looked sad yet at peace, eyes full of love for Humanity's Hope .. He saluted Eren, his right fist over his heart, left fist behind his back before disappearing and finally Eren realized, Levi was never going to come back."
"Levi lived his whole life in a cage. His shackles followed him wherever he went which wasn't far at all. To them he was a test subject. To them he was something they could do whatever with. They could beat him, torture, inject him with unknown fluids, take pictures... By now Levi was use to these harsh terms he called life. Sometimes he'd even embrace the pain, that was all he ever knew after all. But just like children, they get tired of their toys and eventually throw them away. Thus an auction is held. What happens when they decide to sell him? They don't care if he's sold into pieces or whole as long as their pockets are full. Levi however, was use to his life... Now he had the opportunity to be free? A chance to escape. Easy right? He wished. Levi was a frightful yet, very beautiful and elegant creature. His luscious wings attracted many from everywhere. Mutant. That's what he is. People feared him yet lusted for him. So who's the lucky buyer? No other than an ocean eyed brat of course."
"【 reiner x male! reader 】 When your soulmate cries, your eyes began to water. Unexpectedly so; you have seen cases where one of your friends randomly cries when both of you are talking. It worries you at first, but rapidly they explain is ‘their soulmate crying’."
"Levi crossed the door and went out into the backyard. His footsteps in the snow, he wasn't looking his way. Everything was white."
"He’s a horrible man, but he's never claimed to be anything else."
"Reiner made an anxious face and went to sit on the ground next to his cousin, putting a hand on Gabi’s shoulder. He leaned over and pressed a kiss to her temple, Gabi closing her eyes and letting a couple of tears drip out. (Zombie AU)"
"Shortly after Trost, an accident occurred, leaving Jean totally blind in both eyes. Though many would have cast him away as useless, he was still recognized for his skill, and a compromise was reached - he would be allowed to stay in the Survey Corps, as long as he always had an assistant to serve as his eyes. It's a very familiar voice that greets Jean every day, directs him, cares for him, but it's also very painful to hear. It's the sound of his best friend's voice. His best friend, who he had seen lying dead on the streets of Trost."
"The Survey Corps can get a bit lonely some days. Luckily, Jean has his friend to keep him company."
"When he called her name and she looked back at him, he quickly realized that her eyes had the same look as they did a year ago when she stood on stage the day of the reaping and it tied knots in his stomach. It's happening again. She's leaving again. And he's helpless again."
"Everyone's wrist has a timer on when they are predicted to die. Seems simple enough, right? (Originally written for Inktober 2016)"
"Rage and wrath dawn his face, melded with his vicious Alpha and pious identity. Eren Orion Jaeger is one of the most feared men in Cepheus. He is well-known for his murderous hunts, his God-fearing personality, and by a small few - his rather soft relationship with his long-term Omega companion - Levi. After finally being released from prison, Eren ventures into the complexities of being in love, and understanding his violent lifestyle does not make him a suitable mate. Levi denies his advances every year, and with each decline, Eren feels his hollowness growing vacant. In a world where Beta control everything, Levi stands as a perfectionist Omega graduate student majoring in Alpha/Omega Dynamics and Evolution. His research is sensational, though it is continuously rejected and undermined by Beta professors. With his passion beginning to dwindle, his tumultuous relationship with Eren suffers. *updated with pictures :)"
"""This is my body. It was built to kill you. Not to please you, not to satiate you. To kill you."" Mikasa weighs the pros and cons of feeling like a human being, and feeling desire for another person. Bertolt should have weighed them earlier."
"""Who am I, then?"" the man asks, the smallest tilt of his lips upward visible. “You're Erwin Smith, the 13th commander of the Scouting Legion, a well respected man, an excellent strategist, and the best possible person to be commander after the fall of Wall Maria!"" Eren blurts. ""Is there truly no one else who remembers?"" Erwin questions, and Eren nods to confirm it. No one else remembers, until trouble finds Eren like it always does, and he's saved by a familiar face. Then, everyone starts to remember, and it becomes increasingly difficult to keep his secrets under wraps."
"A romantic dinner date is more than it seems. Eren loves Levi, and no one will get in the way of his love. No one."
"Eren Jaeger is sharp, determined and hard working but doesn't consider himself beautiful or good looking in the least. When he lands his dream job, working at Survey Corp Publications as the Executive Assistant to a high-end Fashion magazine's Editor-in-Chief, his life is turned Topsy-Turvy. All he wants to do is work hard to become an Editor, but his boss Levi seems keen on making his life a living hell. Levi is a notorious playboy who gets what he wants both in and out of the bedroom. As Editer-in-Chief of New York's best selling high-end Fashion Magazine, Levi is forced to work with an overly determined, hot-headed brat with a rat's nest for hair and the most incredible eyes he's ever seen and it's all because of Erwin Smith."
"It's been 4 years since Levi walked away from Eren to fight. The war finally ended, and Levi decides to come back home."
"The constant disheartening unsuccess rate of Levi's Squad missions slowly transformed most of Commander Levi's inferiors - himself included - into bitter caricatures of themselves. The team's frustrations ricocheted off of each other, some being struck deeper and more painful than others, and transformed the Survey Corps into a miserable place to escape from. In Jean's mind, nothing, including Eren's life and his supposed key to saving humanity, was worth fighting for anymore. Priorities inevitably change over time, but Jean's desire to peacefully live away from war with Armin dangerously rebelled against the oath and dedication he pledged to the Survey Corps at fifteen. The fate they chose, or if they decided to leave, would eventually kill them. But...how satisfied would they be if they had never attempted to trial their life away? What extreme measures will they have to take to avoid the Survey Corps' equally as extreme consequences? Not only for their escape, but their sinful status as lovers."
"When I found her she was already far too gone for me to save her."
"Eren and Mikasa are always at odds, their relationship only fracturing further after Eren's betrayal. When given the option to finally open up, fight back, and peel the layers of their relationship- they take it."
"You were different from him, yet cut from the same cloth. And it took someone like you to intrude upon his life and turn everything upside down in order for him to finally heal... A collection of short stories that examines the on-going relationship between Levi x Reader. Most stories will consist of a “past memory” and a “present day” parallel scene. Note: For all the readers who want a simple, quick read - each chapter entitled “A Slip of Emotion:...” can be read as a one-shot! Meaning that you don’t have to read one chapter in order to know what’s going on in the next. The only real difference is that the reader’s character stays the same, and the stories are more or less in chronological order. If you would like to read every story in order, however, they do all tie together."
"on a night that Erwin is losing grip with his humanity, he confesses to having inappropriate thoughts about Levi. Levi is shocked by this confession and that Erwin would get forceful with him, but before long, he is forced to acknowledge that he might not actually hate it."
"Mikasa and Levi are facing some serious problems."
"Levi has always had the hope of one day finding Eren in this new life. One day it eventually happens, but the man he finds isn’t the one he remembers. There is something different about him Levi can’t quite put his fingers on… but his curiosity might be the first step into a situation Levi won’t be able to escape."
"` after everything, Levi and Hanji started living together but there was one issue - Levi's overprotectiveness."
"As they juggle the fate of humanity in their hands, the weight of betrayal and lost friendships weigh heavy on the trio's shoulders. Can they find forgiveness? Will Eren and Mikasa reunite? Most importantly, what happens when it's all over?"
"Levi knew finding answers wasn’t going to be easy, but there was no better place than Yharnam to do that; the town had many secrets, too many to slip under his radar."
"A boy and a girl.  One’s lived life growing up in the dark underworld of a cruel and unrelenting world, and the other, while living in a world of modern comforts, has been tested in more unseen ways.  Despite being from two entirely different worlds, time and space itself seems to bend to bring them together.  Starting with a chance meeting in their tender youth, their lives weave together across entire universes, tethered together in ways they’re only beginning to discover. “Love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within.” –James Baldwin “Love is like a friendship caught on fire.

"Armin and Erwin were always close to each other like a married couple, but when things go under way between them, what would happen to them? Armin's POV. Takes place in Taking Choices of my Eren X levi mpreg series."
"Eren found the documents entirely by accident. An Unwind AU."
"Ymir was a bad person. Because, life was easier when people stopped bothering with you. It was easier when you didn’t have to care or worry about what others were thinking."
"They took Eren out of the airship blindfolded."
"This is a spin-off series of ""Walking Dogs And Shitty Jokes"", told from Armin's point of view: Armin was beginning to think he just had bad luck with guys. His first love turned out to be a one-sided crush on his best friend, and now he was being asked out by another guy who had just gone through a bad break up of his own. Kissing someone you don’t even love would be wrong... right?"
"He dreams of when he first met Erwin. Of the first time he killed a man, of the first time he killed a titan, of how it didn't differ that much. Of vast fields of grass and clear skies that made something clench in his chest. He wants neither to sleep nor be awake, but can only pretend for so long."
"An unlikely relationship told in fifty sentences."
"Night by night, the shadows grew darker inside their home and inside their hearts."
"In a world where secondary-genders define you, and countries are ruled by Kings and Queens; Erwin Smith searches for a legendary, destined mate to give him power and stature. A mate to help him rule, a mate to love, a mate to cherish. Levi isn't looking for any of that, content with his rough life-style and existence. When the two are brought together, it reveals a string of confusion, hurt, betrayal, and adventure. Welcome to; Lost Alliance."
"Levi gave Eren 3 days to calm down and returns home to await Eren's decision. This is the last part of the drabble series."
"My name is Eren Yeager. And I belong to my mistress completely."
"And as her form in the sand became smaller and smaller, I couldn't take my eyes off of this young woman that lightened, like the moon itself, some pitch black years of my life. Erwin, the Scouts leader, was clutching my shoulder, trying to show me some sympathy. The car carried us further, back to the walls, back to the concrete cage, until she became a small dot on the cold, windy beach in September.Life had a dark sense of humor. The driver broke the heavy silence: ""You'll make a great teacher, Levi. And an even better undercover Scout."" ""To teach what, Mike?"" I frowned. ""Some bullshit propaganda the Titan Party allows? Sickening manifestos to justify their gruesome murders? Or should I tell those children what philosophy really means, about free will, equity and liberation, when I know so well they will experience anything but that?"" ""That's what we're fighting for, Levi."" Erwin sighted. I continued to stare at that poor, sad, small dot, that never stopped waving me goodbye. ""I'm really leaving, dear."" I wanted to say to her, as my last words, ""So as to always love In this grief, so marvelous, Of never keeping you. Of never being able to allow this love to leave us dead"""
"The titan's curse isn't the only legacy of Ymir. It is fate, and no matter how hard he tries, Levi cannot escape the fate birthed by his own mother."
"""Eren holds him down, wordlessly, as humanity’s strongest writhes. Ties his wrists and ankles to keep him still, and resets his leg with one, swift movement. Levi screams, calls Eren everything he can manage in one breath, and passes out."" Eren never meant to hurt his friends. Least of all Levi."
"The Underground was a difficult place to survive in, it was common place to witness murders or attacks- Levi knew this, he’d grown up with it. However, it was even harder to survive when every movement sent a spike of pain through your torso. OR Trans!Levi and his story running from being a thug in the Underground to “Humanity’s Strongest Solider.”"
"Eren has memories of a past life where he was with Levi. But Levi doesn't remember. The boys grow up together, but due to circumstances lose contact. After a period of time they reconnect--can they make things work out? Note--the first few chapters are going to be when the boys are in middle school (approximately 6-8 grade) and then high school before a time skip. The rating WILL GO UP to EXPLICIT."

"Eren was no saint. He hurt people, people he loved and people he didn’t even know. But all’s fair in love and war. And he truly thought what he was doing was right, even if he was sacrificing everything. People say peace doesn’t come without a price. They’re right . . ."
"The war is over, humanity is expanding, and Erwin finally thanks Levi."

"The one where Levi spent five nights confronting the truth that he had just lost his entire squad. That he had lost her. And the one where their last five days flashes in Petra's eyes."
"The first time this had happened it could have been a simple accident. Though Levi is not known for being scatterbrained, Eren understands he sometimes gets absorbed in his work and loses track of time. He had brushed it off and not thought much about the captain's absence. The second time it had happened it could have just been a coincidence. Now -the third time- Eren can no longer ignore the reality of the situation. Levi is avoiding him, and Eren has no idea why."

"""I wish that I could wake up with amnesia, and forget about the stupid little things, like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you, and the memories I never can escape."""
"Time has passed slowly since the incident involving the female Titan. Since Eren's decision. Since Levi had come to hate him. Or at least that's what he'd like to believe, because how can he accept that he's falling in love with the reason his squad is dead."
"Eren was her hero. He would always be her hero. But Mikasa no longer wanted to be a part of this story."
"“I doubted you for awhile, but I was never mad at you Levi, I can never be…”"

Reencountering people from her past, mysteries to unravel and learning that not all people have good intentions. But most importantly, she will also discover new and intense emotions after meeting a certain Captain surrounded by walls of ice. So different, yet at the same time so much alike, what starts with mutual irritation and displeasure grows into something that will make them question everything they thought they knew. Can Lena's light melt the ice of humanity's strongest soldier?"
"The stars were out now, shining through the wispy skeletons of barren trees, their forms reduced to naught but bones by winter’s embrace. They looked like vines. Twisting, reaching, grasping; suffocating their neighbours and fighting for the moon’s attention like leaves did the sun."
"Everyone knows that superpowers are the stuff of stories, nothing more than nonsense to give kids something to be excited about... right? Ever since manifesting otherworldly abilities when he was just a child, Jean Kirstein has been hidden deep in the bowels of SURVEY headquarters, a group designed to 'train' people like him for 'their own safety'- yeah, bullshit. He was perfectly content being the resident asshole of his team of superpowered freaks, but after he’s tasked with helping kidnap a newly manifested Deviant from his family home, Jean realizes that he may have to protect more than just himself. Marco, the prior mentioned Deviant, struggles to acclimate to his new life, especially when a certain doctor who may or may not have a screw loose takes a special interest in him."
"Erwin Smith is a gladiator for house Marcellus. Recently purchased, he must become worthy of a wealthy ludus.

"The familiar tones of green and amber have been taunting him from afar ever since he’s learned how to stand on his own two feet again. It’s just a simple hickory tree. It’s only a few metres ahead of him, but Levi hasn’t been able to reach it."
"The first time you lay eyes upon Armin, you can’t help but pity him."
"Jean can't take life and it's hardships anymore; its too much to handle for him. He feels like he is about to explode, like a time-bomb that constantly ticks away. But Marco helps him rise from his ashes, in a rather different way. Jeanmarco week, Day 5: Ash."
"It was only a matter of time... After all, breaking a rule was no simple laughing matter but was it worth it? Levi/Reader"

"Ymir and Historia share one last moment before Ymir leaves to help Reiner and Bertholdt. — A very short, quick fanfiction that is set in the same episode where Ymir says goodbye to Historia, except I decided to change it around a little bit. They deserved a few more moments together, and this is simply that."
"From sitting on bridges to meeting in coffee shops. From friendship trouble to Calculus tutoring. From carnival dates to Christmas parties. From birthday picnics to cemeteries. From guilty confessions to meeting childhood friends. From beer pong games to quoting Lady Gaga. From cute berets to food fights. From innocent dinner parties to exposing games of Never Have I Ever. From dancing in the rain to first times. Eren and Levi had gone through it all. But Levi didn’t know if he would be able to get through this."
"Levi beat the shit out of Eren in that court room. Everyone saw that episode. But what if someone changed the course of things from that very moment? Well, I did that and that's how this fic was born. Eren and Levi on their way to kill titans and make love. From complete strangers to friends and maybe even something more."
"Singing in each other's ear. Silly conversations. Heartfelt smiles. Everything finally falling into place. Their much awaited post wedding dance is about to happen."
"After another failed expedition, Levi can no longer remain silent about his true intentions for Erwin. Sometimes I slide away Silently I slowly lose myself Over and over Take comfort in my skin Endlessly Surrender to my will Forever and ever Heaven - Depeche Mode"
"""I love you,"" Levi mumbled into his hair, placing a lingering kiss there. ""That's not going to fix me, Levi."""
"'YOUR FAULT. And it was true as well,' Levi thought, 'he should have been watching, making sure they were okay, but now they were fighting for their lives. His squad. He was the Captain, not some stupid new rookie.'"
"Erwin can still remember the sound of his father’s voice, soft and gentle but vibrant as he detailed the expanse of the world outside the walls. Erwin thinks of how, with his own foolishness, he silenced it."

"I wrote this story a long time ago and honestly I just remember my intention of this story was to try and get the feeling of near obsession when it comes to someone you idolize and I remember when I first watched Attack on Titan The relationship between Eren and Levi was idolisation of an authority figure and a stupid kid who just wanted to be regonised as not a monster and trusted. So yeah that's the feeling I wanted to come across and I'm not going to re-read this as the writer it just...yikes the cringe."
"Erwin doesn’t move, doesn’t blink, just stands there staring down at Levi.  Levi stares back, holding his gaze.  He could kill him here, now, it would be so easy.  He’s armed, Erwin’s injured, and there’s no one else about. But Erwin’s death would no longer serve any purpose.  So much has changed in these last twelve hours. Lifetimes have passed; Farlan’s, Isabel’s, what ever his own life was before.  The only connection to them he has left is the bloody badge crumpled in his pocket, this uniform and, somehow, this man standing in front of him.

"It's hard enough leaving the love of your life behind, but it's even harder coming face to face with him again under less than desirable circumstances years later. Young and Vulnerable follows the story of Jean Kirschtien, who has been desperately in love with Eren Jaeger since college, and his struggle to come out of the closet. Or that story in which Eren and Jean meet again and Jean keeps trying to get in Eren's pants, but Eren is dating Levi and Jean just got married to Mikasa."
"Bedding the Commander will not be easy... How will a thug from the royal capital be able to walk forward alongside Humanity's Strongest, especially when the thug is a woman in disguise and in love with the Commander?"

"“Why the fuck are you out here, Mike?” “Can’t old comrades see each other?”"
"What’s the point in measuring how many years you’ve lived when any day you might die? He tells himself this and he tells himself that he doesn’t care, the way he tells himself he doesn’t care about a lot of things, and he tells himself he doesn’t know today was Erwin’s birthday even though he does."
"Kenny and his squad survived the roast chicken titan's transformation, kidnapped Armin and Hanji while Levi's squad was busy dealing with the titan, and are planning to have some 'fun' with them..."
"“the world could burn in her wake, and you would still tread through the ashes to follow her.”"
"You had always been different and led a rather lonely existence, rarely letting anyone get too close to you. Memories of lost companions had hung vivid in your mind and your past had made you the person you were today - strong, determined and focussed. Using that strength, you decided to answer the call of enlistment, pushing all of your skills towards a goal. A purpose. Choosing the path of the survey corps was obvious as you had an unrivalled strength in your trainee squad and wanted to put it to good use for once. You had not expected what awaited you when you entered the imposing grounds of the survey corps HQ, the man you were reunited with and were wholly unprepared for the journey that followed."
"How do you even summarize a poem? It's just a sad little poem about Eren and Levi's love in canon-verse...."
"Jean and Armin have a deal to meet from time to time and be together in order to relieve the stress of their intense lives. However, Jean realizes his feelings for Armin might be real, but not reciprocrate. So he ends up letting his insecurity and jealousy take over.

"el-e-gy eləjē a poem of serious reflection, typically a lament for the dead ------ A sonorous laugh escapes my mouth. ""Alright kid,"" I say, bringing his lips down to mine. After a moment, I pull away and gaze up at him. Light from the dying sun bouncing off his brown hair and framing his face, the contrasting shadows making his usually soft face a touch sharper, giving it a more aged appearance. His green eyes holding a certain air to them that's entirely too hard describe but I can't help but feel the overwhelming sense of home and security that's found within them. ""Would you ever die for me, Levi?"" I stare up at him for the longest time; this kid who has managed to effortlessly break down every last barrier I put up. Who I would give up most anything for. And I don't hesitate before saying: ""Over and over."" ------ I do not own any of the characters presented in this series. All rights to anything related to ""Attack on Titan"" belong to Isayama and Isayama alone."
"In a world without titans, Levi babysits Eren, taking care of him in place of Eren's parents just like Levi did in their past lives. But then Levi leaves for college. History has a way of repeating itself, even in reincarnated lives, but this time Levi isn’t around when Eren needs his guidance most. *That summary is vague af because it was for this fic when it was a one-shot. The new summary would mention that Eren is a badass gang member and Levi misses the sweet boy he once knew."
"Levi is obsessively in love with Eren."
"When soulmates meet, they each grow a pair of matching wings. Eren doesn't really give soulmates much thought until the day he gets his wings. To Erwin, having a soulmate is burden that he does not want to bear."
"Hindsight is 20/20"
"Society is segregated by Zodiac signs. The date birth of an individual separates them from one another. Tattoos of each sign's symbol determines visual confirmation of who is safe to talk to. It is a system that has been enriched in the people by the government since the Constitution was first instituted, and has carried on into modern day. Armin wants to change this. And he'll be damned if he's going to do it alone."
"There are some worthy of the divine punishment sought for them, even if their guilt is never as apparent as their innocence."
"Snippets of how Captain Levi and Squad Leader Hanji bonded over the years and eventually fall in love. Too bad they are clueless about it."
"Marco looks at Jean―his face flushed and still, beautifully, breathless―and thinks Jean is far more like a sprout than a shotgun shell. He thinks maybe he might be too. He thinks maybe none of them were ever bullets in the beginning."
"Eren befriends Levi when they're both little kids.  But fate has some screwing around to do.  They lose touch and each longs to see the other again. A/N:  There are memories, time skips, dreams, and flashbacks in this fic that aren't always labeled."
"The job you did was demanding, but you were damn good at it. Always three steps ahead, you were the go-to person in the office. But you didn't let it get to your head and you remained a quiet yet friendly member of the team. After working hours, you often retreated to your second home, leading something of a double life. Your helpful and open demeanour to colleagues and friends hid your darker thoughts inside and you dealt with the daily struggle of trying to keep it all together and be the best you could be. It didn't help that one of the directors of your department was a distraction and you often found your mind drifting to thoughts of him, his dark ebony hair and pale features. Not that he ever looked twice at you. But then, out of nowhere, he did."
"Levi fucked it all up. Where was Eren now? Did he want to know? Based off ""Your Bed"" by All Time Low (with much imagination involved)."
"For his whole life, Levi has found it difficult to socialize and sabotages himself whenever it comes to his happiness. Due to mental illness and some other ""quirks"" as some people call them, he works to make his life perfect, but he's never reached that standard, needing to stop his habit of isolating himself. But being eccentric to others and being wary of everyone doesn't exactly help. And everything changes when some stranger just has to be his friend for some reason he can't figure out. (Warning: some characters are very ooc)"
"A cleaning accident leads to injury, hurt feelings, and a partial breakup of Erurihan."
"But man? Man is stretching so far. The fact is, Marco was only 16. A brief summary of his dying thoughts and reflections. Trying to sound all fancy here but I'm really just writing out some depressing feelings about this poor kid. Based on the weird shot that's only in the anime from Marco's p.o.v. when Jean finds him, leading the viewers to believe he hadn't quite died. So yeah. Free invite to cry with me."
"Zacklay finally made his move. He would strike back against Erwin after the Corps' ""failed"" expedition into Shiangashina. He was about to rip everything from Eren. Eren had a home now, a family, in the arms of two men he'd never imagined he would come to love. But now he can't imagine life without them. The order has been issued: Erwin will take the titan serum. If he loses himself, it will be on Humanity's Strongest to kill him. But then Levi would take his own life, and Eren would be alone again. If all goes well, the Survey Corps will be more powerful than ever. And there's some interesting new research that they recovered from Grisha Yeager's basement lab. Research that could change the fate of Humanity. Since when have summaries ever been my thing? Basically shit happens Survey Corps style in Shiangashina, and all they bring home are some books and some titan serum. Zacklay orders Erwin be the first to try it. Then threesome smut. Then some angst. Then some fluff. This is the intro to a multipart series I'm working on that is (VERY) vaguely crossed over with Full Metal Alchemist. No FMA characters will appear. I'm just stealing alchemy."
"Eren is a big fan of the band ""No Name"",but one day when he thought it was his luckiest day of his life to meet the band No Name. it turns out when he finally meets the lead singer,everything he thought and respected about them was a lie. He learns they were all ghouls from the start. Shingeki No Kyojin and Tokyo ghoul Crossover (Yey another brief crap summary)"
"""They didn’t know him. And that was okay. Because if they didn’t remember him, that meant they didn’t remember the horrors of their past lives, either. They didn’t remember the horror of watching their friends fall around them one by one, or the terror of watching the titans breach the walls. And that alone made him happy."" In a world where Titans are a thing of the distant past, few remember the horrors of the war fought to free humanity from their walled confines. Eren Jäger, reborn and rechristened, spent twenty-one years praying Levi Ackerman wouldn't remember, and hoping that he would."

"Eren gets bitten by a zombie due to some unwise choices. He doesn't want Jean to find out, but ultimately, Jean figures out that something's obviously wrong with his boyfriend. They share their last moments together."
"Eren giggled, nose scrunching up and face reddening and looking so ridiculously adorable that Levi couldn’t do anything other than swoop in and kiss him right on those grinning lips. It was chaste, nothing but a brush of their mouths, but it soothed an ache Levi had been feeling for weeks now. As good as it felt, though, he knew it was a mistake as soon as he pulled back enough to find that obsidian gaze shimmering in pain."
"A one-shot in which an impatient Levi waits for a very late Eren. In which Erwin stalks him, for justifiable but underappreciated reasons. In which Hange anticipates for drama to unfold with a heavy heart. In which people wait, but for different reasons."
"Whilst Eren Yeager didn't have the most conventional of jobs, being a personal escort certainly had its perks. To him there was nothing better than being showered in compliments, taken to fancy restaurants, frequent sex, and even better, being paid for it. Whilst his life wasn't perfect, he had everything he could ever want. So why was he so enamored by the short, grumpy librarian?"
"“You really let this place fall to shit when you’re alone.” Somehow life goes on, cruel and unfair as ever. Somehow, it’s been three days and the door to his office is left wide open though Erwin knows he had locked it. Shutting out the world is one thing, something he learned and honed long before accepting the title of Commander. Shutting out Levi is another thing entirely, almost impossible and decidedly not worth the astounding amount of effort it would take to try."
"Levi Ackerman fell in love with a certain turquoise-eyed brunet since the first time he laid his eyes. For a year, he's just loving him from afar. But one day, this brunet asked him if he could court his sister. What will happen to his unspoken feelings? "" It's funny how the ones who can make you happy are the ones who can also break you. It's fucking ironic, really."""
"One of them has bite marks on his hand because his inner monster made him do it. One of them has a mouth dirtier than anything he owns yet he only speaks 500 words a day. One of them has never seen the ocean but has cried enough tears to fill one. One of them has to maintain a straight face but once it's dark her anxiety takes her breath away. One of them has memorised the bottom of all the bottles he drank to forget about his friend. One of them has to struggle day by day to keep the food that she eats down. One of them has to make up her own world because she doesn't dare to face reality. All of them long to see the world behind their walls."
"“Eren should be here.” Those were the first words spoken by anyone in the group who had discovered the Ocean again. (Or, they reach the Ocean and Eren isn't there to see it.)"
"About to return from practicing fighting, Shikishima is surprised and delighted to find the person he holds dear to him waiting for him. He reflects on who he is though, and if she'll still love him when she finds out."

"Virgin America, America's best Airline recruites only the finest employees, including top ranked pilot Captain Levi and co-pilot Erwin Smith. Eren Yeagar just graduated college and turns to Portland International Airport looking for a job as a flight attendant."
"Eren anticipates Levi's death (Not a manga spoiler, just for this fic), just as in their previous life. Shocked to see him come home. Terribly summary! Hope it's okay."
"He's made the decision to take the next step in recovery, but that won't be the end of the journey. Harboring haunting memories and mental illnesses, the struggles in life aren't over. But with the stubborn, bright-eyed one who's proved to be more persistent than the monster itself, Levi becomes stronger than ever, even if at times his weakness comes forth to test that strength."
"It’s with a start that Erwin realizes, now and only now, after all this time and all that hurt, that the Levi of his dreams, his memories, the boy from the Underground with that fierceness, that fight, that desire to live, to burn, his captain who would follow him into Hell with unwavering trust, with love, left him long ago, has been gone perhaps for centuries. He knows now, without a doubt, that this is his punishment, this sadness that constricts and binds and consumes, this exhaustion that he has breathed into the only person who has ever given Erwin’s cursed existance any meaning. One thousand years or more of suffering, and it is his doing and his alone. He has taken everything Levi has ever had, whether the man was willing to give it or not, and has left him empty."

"After their return from Shinganshina the survivors are doing their best to pick up the pieces.  When someone intrudes on their fragile peace, will it be an opportunity--or disaster?"
"And then she realised. Maybe this was what he meant about them being similar. Maybe he wasn't telling her any of this, as such. Maybe he was looking into a mirror, speaking only what he felt in his own heart, as much to himself as anyone else."
"Erwin is gone and so is Levi's will to move on. With the help/supervision of others, he survives, but not thrives, to see the day of humanity's freedom. With everyone busy, he decides it's time he finally made someone very dear to him an important visit."

"The date is June 17, 2017. Eren Jaeger is just a normal high school student with no life. In fact, it had become kind of boring. Eren didn't do much other than go to school and play video games with his best friend Armin. Little does he know that his whole world is going to change right in front of his eyes. A couple days after summer starts,  Eren sees an unusual shaped object fall from the sky. When he goes to investigate, he finds it to be a strange metallic sphere. On closer inspection, it reveals itself to be a ship, and on the inside is a beautiful creature unknown to Eren. Eren now has two choices. Will he give him to the authorities that continue to come to his door? Or Will he protect the strange creature from the humans who wish him harm? When everything goes down Eren will find himself strangely attached to him. This creature is so far from home, and Eren knows he will eventually wish to return. What if he can't let him go?"
"After having turned into a Titan for the first time, Armin encounters Jean again."
"Flowing through life like a warm summer breeze was as good as it could be expected. No real worries, no deep-rooted troubles, no regrets—but that also meant having no ambitions whatsoever. When 18-year-old Eren Jeager leaves his hometown to go to college, he never expected to realise how much of a wasteful, feverish fool he'd been all his life. But above all, he never expected to fall in love. Surprisingly, all it took was a very shitty new college life, some tattered books, and a few crumbling autumn leaves."

"When Armin and Erwin discover that the old world had a holiday called Christmas, which just happens to fall on Levi's birthday, Erwin decrees a celebration for the Survey Corps. Secret gifts, Christmas tree disasters, and other shenanigans ensue... and keeping the celebration secret might be harder than they thought. Canon divergent wherein certain people are actually alive. Slightly crack. Lots of fluff. Each ship gets their own chapter."
"Everyone has a red thread tied to their ring finger. They're fickle things, growing thicker, getting thinner. They reflect the status of your current relationship or connect you to your next one.

"Rivaille had always been alone."
"Eren walks in on Rivaille reflecting on that day…"
"Breathing was easy. No matter what, he had to keep going. Forgetting about Marco was slightly harder. The images of his friend as a corpse still haunted him. Opening up to someone about it was extremely difficult. However, there had been something about Armin that night that allowed him to do so. And confronting himself about the blossoming emotions he felt for his newfound acquaintance might just kill him. ""In a world where everyone's dying, can you live for me?"" Or, a story that gives an extremely long reason for why Armin Arlet gets a haircut."
"--- Were you in a deep sleep? Do you think you are still dreaming? --- Levi can feel when his heart stops beating, when there's more of his blood on the ground around him than there is pumping through his veins. He knew he'd rush headlong into death after Erwin, but he hopes his sacrifice bought those damn brats enough time to end it. Finally. There is a moment where he must be dead; a contented, restful moment, before he is gasping into life again, hands twisting against a wound that is no longer there."
"Written for a prompt on the kink meme. Eren is gravely injured while on a mission; Jean is terrified that he's going to lose another important comrade (just like Marco)."

With his memories of a past life and past lover still fresh in his mind; Levi lives his life wishing he didn't have them or wishing he wasn't alone. So how will he start to feel when his lover returns but has no memory of him? Levi must do everything ihe can to make Eren remember - he doesn't want to be alone anymore."
"Marco Bodt, a young man seeking to spend a new life in America, boards the RMS Titanic. Little does he know, the next few days he spends on the vessel will impact his life beyond his wildest dreams."
"Even during the worst of times, Jean could rely on Marco to brighten his day. An obvious songfic with plenty of fluff, sex, and angst."
"He was a brat that stole, kill and ran away for survival, having nothing more than the rag on his back and his wits. But that all changed when a mysterious man with gleaming green-blue eyes and an arm picked him off the slums and taught him everything that made him now. ...Until one day...he wasn't there anymore...

Problem is, he doesn't know what to do with this kid."
"Hanji doesn't tend to listen to Levi's advice often, usually ending in her running off somewhere. But even with Levi around she is not always certain to return in one piece."
"There are some things that you just don't talk about. Some things that aren't meant to be listened to, are not meant to be seen, are not meant to be understood. That's why they fit together so perfectly, like puzzle pieces. They were not meant to be seen or heard or understood. They were not meant to be talked about. Eren and his impossible ability to bend and break things with just his mind alone. Levi and his ability to bend and break just Eren with his words. We're going to talk about them anyways."
"Marco is still trying to get back into the swing of things a year after an accident that cost him his eyesight and his right arm.

"Jean lays in bed the night after the cleanup of Trost and the discovery of Marco's death."
"To tame a beast that was once human, one must act like one, think like one, and feel like one. Still, Levi knew he didn’t need to do that.

It's all in good nature of course, they couldn't possibly know its anything but you adjusting to your height, but when Reiner laughs too it stops being a little thing and starts to seem more like a parasite. You feel sick."

"He knows his heart is best kept stashed away, but instead, he keeps taking it out, again and again, because he can't help it, and now it's tarnished. He'd be a lot better off, and more efficient besides, if he didn't care, but Levi has always been bad at not caring."
"He never thought it would come to this, but really, he should have seen it coming. Standing over her rotting form, he realizes now that it was inevitable."
"It all started with a bouquet and a job offer. The two unlikeliest of things, soon intertwined into one. All it took was one decision; thought by two minds. ~~~~~~ Eren Jaeger is twenty three years old, and is a current student at  Kyojin University, where Titans rise! Levi Ackerman is a famous photographer that resides in Los Angeles, and has been offered a job to photograph the beauty of the small town, Trost. If by not fate, then coincidentally these two paths cross, what will be in store for the two?"

Despite his baby face, broad forehead and dumb-ass haircut, you think he looks quite pretty in the moonlight. He looks peaceful. You stumble out of bed and shake him vigorously by the shoulder. “It’s freezing,” you state. You start to feel like a bit of an idiot waking him up like this but the thought of backing down sort of hurts your pride. “Let me in your bed. Warm me up.”'"

"One night Eren was walking to his apartment and suddenly he stumble on something or someone... He meets this mysterious man and Eren life will change but will it be for better or worts?"
"Life went by, but things weren't simple by any means. Levi was still yet to experience Alphas visiting the House and choosing Omegas of their liking for purposes he couldn't even force himself to think about. His body shuddered involuntarily. What would happen if someone picked him? Pestering thoughts plagued his mind as warm water from the shower hit his face and chest. There were other Omegas around him, scrubbing their bodies and exchanging hasty whispers, but Levi kept his eyes closed, detaching himself just as he always did. Lost in his own nightmares, he listened to the droplets of water hitting skin.

Regardless, it left him nearly half blind, struggling to adjust to life without his arm, and perhaps most pressing, a prisoner of war in Marley. The few months his spends in the war prison in Liberio prove to be as educational as they are terrifying- the world is so much bigger than he'd imagined, filled with other people, ideas, with magic. When he finally managed to escape that, he had no clue where he was going or how he was going to get home. That is, until he finds himself people willing to help. Primarily Marco's perspective. No knowledge of anything beyond AOT is necessary to understand things, as magic, other characters and plots are being introduced as he learns. Extremely long play JeanMarco (After being asked plenty of times on TikTok, I'm posting this! It's heavily based off of the RP I have done over discord with a friend.

Get me to the fucking trees and you can leave me behind again.” With a low grunt that’s neither an agreement or disagreement, Tobio simply says, “ No . That’s not happening.” Whether Kei takes his word or not is out of his control and purview at the moment. They have more urgent matters at hand: the stray Titan approaches. “Can we outrun this?” Tobio shouts over the rush of wind, and it’s only the desperation of keeping them alive that he doesn’t even feel the twinge of hurt pride for depending on Kei’s expertise. “Or do we fight?” “We fight,” Kei says, “ together .” *** Five years have passed since Wall Maria fell, and along with it, any semblance of trust between Kei and Tobio. On the 57th Exterior Scouting Expedition, the devastation wrought by the Female Titan forces them to work together to survive."

"He’d never forget Nile and the way his lips felt on his. The boy whom he thought was cute five years ago. The boy who held him two days ago after his relationship with Marie came to a sad end. The boy whom he let slip away. The boy whom he’d never forget for as long as he lived."
"Eren Jaeger is a college student studying for a degree in marine biology while working in the stickleback lab at his university. He dreams of researching and exploring the deepest parts of the ocean. His favorite food is free food. He does all of his papers at the last minute. He loves pizza.

And he's every supervillain's favorite target. please note: last three chapters are bullet fic only and would have made up about 30% of the complete story"

"Their faces are close together in hushed conversation and Mikasa keeps looking between the gold of his eyes and his lips. Perhaps Eren notices because he places a hand on her thigh and makes the first move; delicately and chastely placing his lips against hers. The move is a bit bold on Eren’s part and makes Mikasa shakily inhales, hands rattling as she raises a palm to settle against his cheek and kisses him back. Behind them, amongst the din of blood rushing through her ears, she can hear her friends whooping and hollering, and a shout of ‘finally’. She laughs quietly to herself more than anything and Eren eyes her with a smile and leans in to kiss her again, and for a moment, the world is more beautiful than it’s ever been."
"Levi and Hanji have a little dispute about Eren because Levi can't let go of him."
"“You shouldn’t get closer.” Levi pulled away, his left hand draping over the spot on his neck that Erwin had been playing with for the past minute. The imprint of warmth that was left suddenly became cold, it made Levi shiver pitifully. “I want to, though.” Erwin said simply. “I know you do too, Levi.” “I hurt people. All I do is bring doom, sadness and misery onto people. If you choose to do this the same thing will happen to you and I don’t want that to happen. I can’t let that happen to you because I—” “You what?” Erwin stepped closer, his voice straining a bit as he inquired further. He knew he was going to say it. He needed him to say it. “Say you love me, Levi. Just this once.” “I will live on and forget you.” Erwin’s face drew blank for a second. “You won't.” “I will.” Levi said with more vigour. “If my fourth life comes and I don't forget I won't be able to live with myself for the other five I would have left.”"
"It wasn't their choice to marry each other. Love was not the base of their marriage, but their needs. And there was a little brat who tied Levi & (y/n)'s life as a couple. One has a standoffish nature and the other was a gregarious person. Marriage last because two people make a choice: to keep it, fight for it, work for it. Will the polar opposites keep it or break it at the end? DISCLAIMER -I do not own the pictures used in this story & any characters from AOT. Only this story plot belongs to me."
"Levi Ackerman is the frontman for the hit band No Name, operating under the pseudonym ""L"". His bandmates, Hange and Miche, all enjoy their private lives, and keep their identities under wraps; the fact that the mysterious secrecy boosts their sales is just an added bonus. On a fateful night in a twisted chain of events, Levi finds himself arrested and in need of a lawyer. Enter Eren Jaeger, young, successful, and famous celebrity lawyer. The man is the definition of perfection; charitable, kind, and in possession of sarcastic wit. He has loving, successful (if a tad extremely conservative) parents, a beautiful actress as a girlfriend, and a profitable career. The problem? Eren is straight as an arrow, and Levi is thirsty for that ass. Everything, however, is not as it seems, and the entire situation becomes convoluted at a rapid pace. They're on a rollercoaster, and the tracks break off into nothingness at the end of the ride. Can they survive the whirlwind that is each other?"
"Hanji Zoe finds Captain Levi in the room he chose as Erwin's final resting place. There he comes to understand just what it feels like to succumb to years of repressed, true grief.

"The Avians and Serpiente have been at war for hundreds of years with no future of ever ending it. But one mistake and a show of mercy from a recruit might be all the Serpiente needed to try to reach for a peaceful resolution with the Avians. However, just because peace is being talked about doesn't mean there aren't some working in the shadows to keep the war going. “Why did you hold his hand?” Historia’s quiet voice interrupted Shadi’s angry tantrum. The whole room got quiet and looked at Eren, who was trying hard to make himself as small as possible. Once he realized that everyone’s attention was on him, he swallowed loudly and looked up at his queen. “Because everyone deserves mercy, and he asked me to end his life instead.”"
"Eren's therapist tells him to try drawing to vent his frustrations of being constantly plagued by nightmares, and it leads to him rescinding his university applications to become a mangaka instead. Four years later, his very popular manga ""Shingeki no Kyojin"" is being turned into an anime, and the most exciting thing about it was that his agent told him the studio was able to get a hold of his favorite band to sing some of the songs for the OST. Eren hoped he would be able to meet them! Now if only his blunt and crabby neighbor could let him draw in peace to meet his deadlines... (HIATUS)"

"“We could go hang out over there...with that.”  Levi followed the direction Isabel’s finger was pointing.  Standing at a tall table at the outer edge of the dance floor was a tall blonde talking to a couple at the table.  Levi watched as he turned and scanned the crowd almost self-consciously.  He was easily the most attractive man Levi had seen in a long time.  He had broad shoulders, a trim waist, and a fantastic ass.  The chiseled jaw, high cheekbones, and a set of full, soft lips was the stuff of fantasies.  He was stunning, and Levi was interested.  Levi then watched as he nodded at something and started to make his way across the room."

"The fever wasn't what told him Jean's fate. The festering wound on his shoulder was what sealed it. Fevers passed. Communicable illness was dangerous, but not a death sentence.

"“I was just thinking about you, and wondered what would happen if I called…”. Then a very unattractive, uncharacteristic belch. “You must have had a lot to drink.  I doubt that you have thought of me much at all this past few months.”  Erwin’s mouth audibly snapped shut before he could say anything more.  He was supposed to be over this. “You’re wrong,” Levi said softly after a long pause, and that wasn’t fair.  Levi had no right to sound like that, like he was as vulnerable and broken as Erwin. “My phone hasn’t exactly been ringing off the hook, so forgive me if I have my doubts.” “I understand why you feel that way, but you’re all I think about-“ “Levi, don’t,” Erwin interrupted, hurt burning in the back of his throat.  “You wanted things to be this way.

"Ymir and Historia used to have a thing, a complicated thing, but now they won't even talk to each other. There is alcohol, drinking games, what could go wrong ?"
"Levi stared at the slender finger resting on his chest, sweat starting to accumulate on his skin from a bizarre combination of horror and exhilaration. He could feel eyes on him, the envious stares doing nothing to alleviate the hell-storm of emotions clawing at his insides. Beneath his alpha’s howls of elation, dread begun to creep through his veins. “Yes…” Teal eyes flittered over him critically, a devious smirk pinching at his cheeks. “I’d like to keep him.”"

"It was the way he walked that got her: the power in his stride, the confidence with which he moved, never arrogant. Each night she became more and more restless, and each night he looked more and more attractive. Something had been building—a pressure slowly rising and liable to burst. And perhaps it had been growing for a while now, well before she'd arrived at his doorstep with a storm at her back. Mikasa was at the end of her rope. And the war had ended a while ago."
"Exhausted, Armin, Mikasa and Eren have a chance to relish in gratitude because they survived the attack on the Trost district."
"It was then, in a little tea shop just off the main street, Eren saw him once again. Face like that of a ghost from the past, dug up from within the deepest confines of Eren's dust filled chest. A man who he'd never expected to see, with his dark eyes and furrowed brow. He looks just the same, but so different. He looks alive... Not like back then, all those years ago. When Eren was freshly parentless and trying to find himself. And Levi, then freshly alone and trying to cope from day to day."

"“Don’t move.” A deep voice, guttural with fury, commanded. A familiar voice, for all he’d never heard it speak in that tone before. Levi stiffened all over, the shell of bloodlust surrounding him cracking straight down the center at the sound. The woman's liver slithered out of his stunned grip to hit the cobblestones with an obscene splat. Every fiber of his body was jumping with shock. He’d been caught. He’d thought—he’d hoped… But he’d been caught, at last, just when he’d thought his cover was more secure than it had ever been. He’d been caught by that fucking blond bastard Erwin Smith. Levi is one of the last ghouls left, and he's not okay with it, but he's dealing as well as he can. Until Erwin finds out, and hatches the plan of using an inhuman monster to fight Titans years before Eren Yeager shows up. Time to show what the original man-eaters can do. (Knowledge of Tokyo Ghoul not necessary to read, knowledge of Birth of Levi gaiden helpful.)"
"True, or false. Real, or not real. What is reality if not a figment of our imagination?"
"They were nothing more than dreams. Nothing more than further proof of an imaginative mind. That's what Eren tried to convince himself as he laid eyes on the stranger with an all too familiar face. It was the same face that had been haunting his sleep for months now. Could this be some bizarre coincidence? Is it possible to dream of someone before having met them? Or perhaps they had met...long, long ago...in a world much different from our own. *THIS WORK IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND CURRENTLY BEING EDITED/UPDATED*"

"All they knew is to expect the worse. Some of them thought it'll be nothing; that they'd seen something that night, that it was a regular group of titans they'd encountered. Levi knew better. As they returned to that dreaded forest, blood flashed behind his eyelids and silent titans haunt his memory, and Levi knew that whatever secrets are in that forest, they're not supposed to know. SEQUEL TO BODY WAS MADE. Probably can be read as a stand-alone, though some things might not be explained. Recommend reading Body Was Made first."
"Eren wouldn’t call their particular group the largest, not by a long shot. There were eleven of them total, not including the newly arrived Marco and Mina. There were far larger groups parading around the 104th Camp. Nor was his group the most famous, skilled, powerful, etc. They were well known, sure, but when you were sharing a revamped Walmart with a hundred or so other people, you tended to become at least partially aware of who your new neighbors were. Despite having a few remarkably fantastic titan killers, they were a remarkably ordinary group of people trying to survive a remarkably terrifying zombie apocalypse. At least, until he was bitten. [DISCONTINUED]"
"Levi is lonely and prideful."
"Prejudice, hatred, war. These three simple factors ended humanity as we know it. Seperated families, destroyed lives, broke people. All due to the governments attempts to purify their nations, to rid themselves of the weak, of the omegas. One of the many side affects of this was the contamination of millions of people, with a virus no one could find a cure fo. These people were lovingly dubbed titans. The bio-engeneering to destroy omega genes was orioginally for parents to pick and chose their children, it was critisized then, so imagine when it was used for mass genicide. Eren Jeager was one of the dwindling population of planet Earth, knowing no life of comfort or pleasure. He was born into suffering and there was no escaping it. He hadn't chosen or wanted this but either way he still got it. Life dealt him the card of not only living in this apocalyptic hell, but also of being the only remaining omega. They were scarce before the enialation, now, even several generations down the line, the chemical still stained the genes of most of humanity, making it a more than a suprise when a baby boy was born, showing clear traits of an omega."
"“What did it look like?” “Hmm?” Levi looked up from his place next to your sleeping form. “The titan that tried to snack on my darling granddaughter.” “Ugly as fuck.” “Aren’t they all?” Levi recounts memories of the reader and their shared life together while she recovers from a serious injury."

"The rain had started up again. Fat droplets drummed over her hood, drenching the fabric. Her horse’s reins were wet and cold; though her fingers, numbed from continued exposure to the elements, could hardly feel them. Following the sound of the explosion, they’d arrived at a clearing. It was a mess of blackened, shattered wood, and the wagon, a skeleton, was little more than a smoking husk. Beyond the wreckage, a titan lay prostrate. Felled, its limp, hulking form was barely visible through the rain. As soldiers shouted, pointing at the creature, one of the horses still tethered to the ruined wagon, writhed. When the beast screamed a broken, panicked wail, her own horse shifted, flanks twitching with unease. Hanji barely noticed. The soldiers' voices, the poor beast’s screams, even the heavy, even thrum of rain - had silenced as she looked to the river. A body lay at the edge of the dark, white-capped water."

When his usual client and boss, Dot Pixis, requests him to personally perform for his VIP group of colleagues Eren will meet the workaholic, sexually frustrated Levi who can't help but want to make Eren his by the end of the night. Problem is, with a clingy ex boyfriend always coming around begging for sex and a particularly handsome bouncer constantly asking for dates, throw in some commitment issues, past drug addictions and a shit past always coming to bite him in the ass, Eren might not be so easy to win over. Can Levi somehow convince this broken boy that he could be the one to fix him?"

"Eren had always been a determined young man, but he could feel his resolve being shaken. His throat went dry and he felt himself getting to the end of his rope. He wanted to take Jean into his arms and kiss him like the world was ending. He wanted to visit Sasha’s grave. To apologize to everyone. To run away with Jean and never look back at the chaos he had helped create. In four years, he wanted to die in peace, in the arms of the man he loved. But he couldn’t have that now."
"He snaps open the cylinder again and fishes a small, lead bullet from his pocket. ""One bullet?"" Annie ventures. ""One bullet,"" Armin confirms, dropping the tiny oblong ball of metal into the first chamber. ""In a perfect game,"" he begins slowly, ""there would be eight shots. Four for me and four for you."" The young man hesitates for a moment before continuing. ""Although, I have a feeling we may not get to all eight. We'll go in turns,"" he says, pressing the gun into Annie's hands.

"Since the beginning, she was there with and for him and had grown to mean something special to Erwin. And of course he didn’t realize it until it was too late."
"Levi found Eren on the streets, lost, alone and beaten. He never wanted to, or even planned to keep the damn boy, but he somehow managed to worm his way into his heart. I mean, who the hell would keep a half cat half human anyway? But even with the charming brat lighting up Levi's life, he was ripped away from him too soon. Where did Eren come from and who wanted to take him back again? Ten years, it took ten years for Levi to have any sort of clue as to where the boy was. Problem was, he wasn't a boy anymore. Instead, he was a man who was seeking Levi out and get him to love him again. (Basically, Eren is half human half cat. Levi hates it but ends up loving the boy.

In a cruel world bent on hunting him down when all he really wants is to belong, the young shifter has been forced to run and hide his real nature from others like him. But fate has a way of throwing curve balls when one least excepts them and Armin's curve ball comes in the form of Eren Jaeger, the pup with the mismatched eyes. Armin knows letting another shifter close is dangerous for his safety yet he can’t resist the strong pull he feels toward the Eren. One night is all it takes, a single moment and everything around Armin is turned upside down.

"“Am I ill? Is it a sickness of the mind?” He fears her every words, the looks she throws without a care and the life she endangers every single day. Her usually lively eyes, filled with rage or concern, seem empty of life under the dying sun. They fill with salty water and despair, and the bags under her eyes suddenly seem heavier than the gears around her hips. She looks down the giant wall, towards monsters and dry lands. “To desire death more than life itself?” Mikasa never falls, but because everything around her does, she doesn’t have anything to hold on to."
"""We'll play till breaking,"" he confirms. She feels as if a majority of their dialogue—it almost seems like a theatrical performance and they each play the opposing roles—is conducted through furtive glances and the controlled inflections in their tone of voice.

But what was the point if he would just end up being comatose? Turning into a ghost and having to possess the body of Armin Arlert didn't make him feel better, and having to put up with Eren Jaeger, a student who was too righteous for his own good, made the situation worse.

I could sometimes spot it there by the forest edge when making a sandwich in the kitchen, or in the corner of my vision while doing homework.

He’d heard stories of big bad wolves that ripped people to shreds with their drooling jowls and razor sharp fangs, and in that moment it truly felt like he was a wild animal that could not be tamed by any man."""

"Erwin leaves him feelin’ off-center.  Leaves him feelin’ small and wretched, like he really ain’t nothin’ more than a petty, stupid criminal.  In the face of Erwin’s far-reaching gaze, lookin’ off someplace Levi can’t even begin to imagine, let alone see.  He feels the weight of his own insignificance, standing next to this man.  The meaningless struggle of his own, poor existence. // Newly forced into recruitment in the Survey Corps, and having lost his family in Furlan and Isabel, Levi struggles to find his place among a world entirely unlike the one he comes from, and around people he can find little in common with."
"Green eyes looked back at you, a lingering look of desperation and love evident his irises. Those same green eyes you could get lost in for days now seemed like any other unimpressionable color out there. Your heart decided that you hated the color green, the shade of his eyes to be specific. But more so than some stupid color, your heart decided that it hated Eren Yeager."

"Eren Jaeger is 18 years old and about to graduate high school and go to university. He's captain of the basketball team, good looking, and smart. Everybody envies Eren Jaeger, the beautiful, strong boy with the two-colored eyes. But Eren doesn't want that. He can't be around people, and he especially can't let them get close to him. You see, Eren is cursed with bringing bad luck to people. It affects everyone, whether they know him or not, but the closer you are to him, the worse it'll be for you. There was one time, though. There was one time he actually let himself fall in love, which lead to a tragic accident and left him devastated. He vowed never to get close to anyone ever again, let alone fall in love. But what happens when he gets to Trost University and meets a certain junior named Levi Ackerman, and the wall he's spent so much time building back up slowly starts to fall once again?"

"“What are you going to do with me, pretty boy?” she asked in a husky murmur, a predatory grin splitting across her face. Insanity flashed in her eyes, and she leaned in even closer, ignoring the knife Levi held at her throat. In fact, the bright little blossoms of blood pricked forth by his blade only seemed to stretch that psychopathic smile up even wider. “Are you going to arrest me, sir?” She yanked him in by his collar, her smile as sweet as honey and as innocent as Lucifer's, and whispered against his cheek. “Or are you going to kill me.” -- The wall has just fallen. Refugees are streaming in, food and rations are stretched inexplicably thin. Business is ironically booming for Astra, who runs a slightly illegal pawn shop. People come to her for many things; souvenirs, vintage trinkets, poison, jewelry, explosives, etc etc. You know, the works. If they have the money, she has the means. She has always been very good about not getting caught. But when scout officials catch her in a lie, the risk of capture runs greater than ever. There is but one way out: join the organisation that holds her freedom hostage, put her life on the line, and flirt with the grim reaper."
"‼️RETITLED FROM The Fate Not Written in the Stars ‼️ -- “What are you going to do with me, pretty boy?” she asked in a husky murmur, a predatory grin splitting her face. Insanity flashed in her eyes and she leaned in even closer, the blade Levi angled at her throat pricking forth bright little blossoms of blood. Her smile, psychopathic, split further. “Are you going to arrest me, sir?” She yanked him in by his collar, her voice, lilting as an angel's and as innocent as Lucifer's, whispered against his cheek, “Or are you going to kill me.” -- Levi has someone he wants to catch. Specifically, a thief that has wounded his ego one too many times. But she has always been very good at not getting caught, until one day, as with all great figures in history, her hubris brings about her downfall and she lands in a trap set by the scouts. Erwin wants her strength. Levi wants her dead. Astra just wants to go home where she can continue breaking the law in peace (is that really too much to ask? she didn't think so). Now her only way out is to join the organisation who holds her freedom hostage, and flirt with the grim reaper."
"“So what are you going to do with me, pretty boy?” Insanity flashed bright and she leaned in even closer, the blade Levi angled at her throat pricking forth bright little blossoms of blood. Her smirk, psychopathic, split wide open. “Are you going to arrest me, sir?” She yanked him in by his collar, her voice, lilting as an angel's and as innocent as Lucifer's, whispered against his cheek, “Or are you going to kill me.” -- Levi has someone he wants to catch. Specifically, a mercenary that has wounded his ego one too many times. But Astra has always been very good at not getting caught, until one day, as with all great figures in history, her hubris brings about her downfall and she lands in a trap set by the scouts. Erwin wants her strength. Levi wants her in jail (or dead, either way goes). Astra just wants to go home where she can continue breaking the law in peace, is that really too much to ask?"

"""It’s been six years since our last expedition outside Wall Maria, and the circumstances have changed. We have no idea where our enemies are located, or how far, and the only way to remedy that is to send out scouts to try and remap the surrounding territory as best as we can.

There were bad people and good people, and those who were lost trying to find themselves, but it wasn't always easy to narrow it down to three columns, it was all subjective, what was good?

Levi Ackerman, a high ranking official within the Survey Corps, is a member of an elite squad whose job is to find vast expanses of viable land in hopes of human expansion and vitality. Already numerous provinces built apart from The Walls, traveling between the countries is strictly regulated--save from trade and Collectors--due to the strange creatures that lurk outside. So when a mysterious attack is exacted upon the Southern Kyoto Gate of Ganshia, Levi grows weary of the silence that follows. Aberrant, the cause for humanity's plight lingers; they never tire, they never sleep, they never stop ... and they're always hungry. Worst of all? They're the least to fear, and humanity doesn't know it yet."

"Not many people really knew Levi, Humanity's Strongest Soldier. His mistery past always sparked questions that were never answered. As a result, nearly nobody outside the Survey Corps knew that he had a daughter. It wasn't that it was kept a secret, per se, but for some reason her existence never attracted much attention. When she was sent to an abusive institute in Stohess District, nobody found out. When she ran away a year later, the Military Police was bribed with quite a decent amount of money to ensure that no one noticed. And so, when Kenny Ackerman found her by accident and coerced her into joining the Anti-Personnel Squad, there was no one there to stop it. Three years later, a titan shifter is found.

It was a great plan until he found Levi again--in a Waffle House, of all places."
"The sound of her voice is like birdsong at first light, gentle and soothing. It’s like music, not the kind that lulls you to sleep, but the kind that rejuvenates your soul and makes you feel light and weightless. It’s the loveliest sound that Zeke has ever heard and he can’t help but feel that he’s heard it somewhere before…"
"Life has its ups and down, something Levi knows well by now. Raised by a single mother with the aid of his uncle, never knowing his father, never staying in one town for too long for most of his youth. Never knowing friendship to its truest potential; until he met Erwin. They’ve been inseparable ever since."
"He shuffles his foot slightly against the asphalt ground before he finally gets his words out. “So, how is she?” the words come out delicate and laced with care, almost like they’re scared that too much push will cause something in Levi to break. Levi chews on the inside of his lip and he finds himself picking at the skin around his fingernails, his left leg rapidly bouncing a fast and steady rhythm on the ground. He stops himself and shoves his hands into his jacket pockets, sighing quietly through his nose and turning to face Erwin for a second; averting his gaze from him just as soon as he gave it, choosing to focus his attention on a line of ants on the driveway instead. “She’s uh- it’s been better, I guess.” He sniffs and rubs his nose, taking a deep breath in, filling his lungs with as much air as he can and exhaling in a huff, trying to settle and calm himself before going on. “But it’s also been worse.”"

Levi becomes infactuated by you and determined to set you free, as well as make you his Empress, but with the snake of a mistress and an obsessive King around you, he has to do everything he can to free you and give you the love you deserve before the damage to your iced heart becomes irreversible and you are lost forever."
"Imelda Becker lived a quaint life in Trost, nestled in the safe walls of Rose. She never went without anything or went hungry, like the starving Maria refugees that she often saw fight in the streets for mere scraps of stale bread. Though her mother was long dead, she had her father and brother's love to fall back on. She had everything she could ever need and more, asking for anything else would just be selfish. But, alas, Imelda longed for so much more than the life she had. She longed for the freedom that the Walls she lived in barricaded her from. She longed to fly as free as a bird. When the opportunity to break out of the confines of Wall Rose presented itself in the form of the Scout Regiment, Imelda jumped at the chance she was given. Little did she know that she would meet people that she would soon come to call her family. Little did she know that she would fall in love with a broad-shouldered, gentle-smiled boy with pain swirling in his coffee eyes.

"Mikasa remembered being six years old, snuggled up under her covers as Papa stroked her hair and told her the story of a servant girl who had a fairy godmother that conjured her a pretty dress for the Prince's ball. Smiling as Papa recounted the young girl's first meeting with the prince, the way their eyes met and they both knew they were destined to be together. Hugging her pillow and grinning when Papa told her that she escaped and married the prince, and they both lived happily ever after. Stories like these kept Mikasa from marrying. She was certain that someday she'd have a moment like that, where she'd lock eyes with someone and know. Papa understood her reluctance to marry a bit better than Mama did, as he'd always told her, ""We Ackermans are special. There's an old family legend that says we only have one great love, all our lives. As such, it's not easy to settle. Your mother, she was it for me: the only woman I'll ever love, all my life.

"You’re the fifth member of the Special Operations Squad, and a hugely dedicated soldier. In fact, you’re affectionately nicknamed Golden Girl by your comrades - the girl that seems to consistently land on her feet, always in receipt of Captain Levi’s praise. Except when things start to go awry, and suddenly you’re making mistakes during training. As much as you hate to admit it, you’ve become distracted … by an infatuation with your Captain. And he’s noticed. When he confronts you, a highly inappropriate solution is laid on the table, quite literally, and lines are crossed."
"Eren was put in an arranged marriage at the age of 21, when his father passed him the CEO position. He married the woman in order to gain more money and not lose all his hard work in his company. In his unhappy marriage, he will try to meet his needs through another person risking her entire reputation, she's Mikasa Ackerman, his personal assistant and best friend. He didn't care for her feelings, he always got what he wanted no matter who was hurt in the process, will he risk losing her forever to satisfy his pleasure? Will she risk her reputation and job to help him even if she's unhappy?"
"Put simply, the pair are pharmacy students focused on nothing else but to receive their Master's degree: where one wants to run her own pharmacy and the other just wants to become a pharmacist because it's easy and tolerable to him. However, first days at universities always lead to meeting new people no matter if you intend to or not, and that's exactly what happens. The two hate each other but are almost exactly alike! They are insufferable to one another, but eventually, push comes to shove, and well, what happens next was inevitable from the start. Giving themselves a chance is a shot at something long-lasting with several bumps in the road. (Set in a modern university world in which the Attack on Titan manga and anime exist so all characters are purely coincidentally named the same but a lot of them are still basically the exact character with a teensy amount of out of character here and there since some of the things they may say or do is what I believe they'd say or do.)"

"If Eren were to ever describe the ocean, it'd be more of a description of Armin with his sun-kissed hair as the brilliant light shimmering over the never ending blue. However, this isn't the way he wanted to describe it as his true dream faded with the person it was attached to."
"In the year 2030, a virus decimated more than a third of the world's population. Fortunately, a vaccine was developed, and injected into the survivors a year later. However, not all were vaccinated. Some were not prioritized while others- refused. In the end, only half of the world's population were fully vaccinated against the deadly infection. In 2033, the Titans appeared, destroying everything in their path. Powerless against the beasts, the survivors managed to take refuge in the cities where tall ramparts protected them. Here they adapted. Barricaded in. Content at first to survive. In 2036, the first physical experiments for inter-dimensional travel were attempted. The goal? To find a place where Earth’s remaining inhabitants could rebuild their lives and no longer live in fear. Erwin Smith is the leader of one of the teams assigned to these trials. His squad, including Hange Zoe, Moblit Berner, and Mike and Nanaba Zacharias, was the first (and so far the only) team to achieve concrete results in inter-dimensional traveling. This result, promising the salvation of humanity, was discovered in 2040. In 2042, the first inter-dimensional expeditions were led by Smith and his team."

With a giant hole in your memories, best thing to do is make some new ones, right? You got along with everybody very well, but the connection between you and Eren? There had to be some science behind that. However, as time went on the answers of life came just as hard as the years rolled by. With every question answered, the people in your life changed. However, you never thought Eren would change. Not...not like this, at least. Even so, will you eventually stop him? Or will you join him?"
"Thinking of Petra, he sighed languidly. She was the perfect wife, really. Agreeable, a good cook, kind and hardworking.

"When there's a break-in at Armin Arlert's house, he comes out of the situation with something he didn't quite expect."
"“Armin,” he spoke and the blond man nodded stiffly as Erwin turned to the woman to his right, “Mikasa,” she ducked her head, her eyes darkening and expression turning blank, “move out.” The two saluted him with their right hand firmly pressed over their hearts, and the two vanished without so much as a sound. Erwin crouched, right hand landing on the cold stone of the fence beneath him and left perching on his left knee. A small smirk tilted his lips, thick eyebrows narrowing for the smallest of fragments as he looked around, eyes nothing could remain hidden from focusing on three massive forms in the crowd beneath him which would pass unnoticed in front of anyone but him. ‘Six hundred years,’ he thought to himself, broad shoulders hunching as he leaned forward and a gust of cold wind made the long, black, leather cloak flail behind him, miniscule rain-drops stinging his face and soaking into sun-colored strands of hair styled in an undercut. ‘Six hundred years and the only thing that changed are the weapons we fight with.’"

"Erwin’s dreams were simple. He yearned to discover what was beyond the walls, and the secret to humanity, and the origin of the Titans. Levi’s were even more simple. A day where they didn’t live as if it was their last. A day where tomorrow was promised. A tomorrow with Erwin."

It was much too good to be true and in the end I was left with nothing but lost memories of a time that I so ardently wished for again. ................... „Y/N, I'm always here for you."" This was the promise I received from my longtime friend and superior officer Hange Zoë, but for me, she was just Hange. She was there for me when I needed someone. She gave me support I didn't know I needed. And then it happened. „I've always loved you. Ever since those days at training corps."" And that was okay. Because I knew I loved her too!"

As a result, Eren will have to come to terms with the death of his friend, fight a brutal war, and discover the horrible truth.

""Kenny told me something before he died. He said that 'everyone was a slave to something'. He had lived his whole life chasing that power. Or, rather, the power of compassion he believed the Founding Titan would grant him. When he gave that serum to me, voluntarily, well... he stopped being a slave. He gave up his dream so that someone else could realize it."""

They're around 16 or 17 here and have been in the facility for about 5 or 6 years."
"Have you ever listened to Cellophane by fka twigs? If not go listen , this fanfic was inspired by it. Its about the inadequacy that the reader feels in the relationship with Eren, and the journey of it and the result of those feelings. I'm honestly just writing this because I really want to improve my writing, as it has been a while since I've written something so I hope you guys enjoy it.

"Levi Ackerman has walked the earth for 863 years. Where before he was a warrior of ancient France, slaying thousands in the name of his country, he is now bound to endless life and to suffer the deaths of his close ones again and again as atonement. When Levi breaks his principles and saves a family of four from certain death, their fates might not be the only ones he changes. Ever since the accident fifteen years ago, Eren Jaeger has been able to see the ghosts that wander the world. His life is a cruel one of loss and terror. Death hunts him and he can't ever let his guard down, lest it might lead to his end. The first time they meet is not truly the first."
"To own the Attack Titan was a heavy burden, one far too heavy to carry by oneself. Kruger knew this. Knew that neither him nor the boy who sought out his company would ever truly be free of it. So why resist temptation and deny them both a small piece of the freedom they'd never get to experience? or: 5 times Kruger kissed Eren goodbye + 1 time Eren did"
"The scent reminded me of her. The way she would read my expressions and look at me caringly always made me feel safe. Her tight comforting hugs never failed to calm me. And I couldn't help but miss her every waking moment. Not a day went by where I didn't think of her face. I wish nothing more than to doze off with my head on her shoulder once more. My Ymir."

"He’d always wanted to be a warrior, had always wanted to live up to his father’s expectations, but the day finally arriving felt anticlimactic. He’d expected a team, a war, companions to live, fight and die with. But, instead, here he stood, staring up at the great outer walls of enemy land with no one to keep him company but the wind, the dry heat of the sun and the crushed corpse of a bark beetle. —— OR the one where Eren was born on the other side. This time Eren is the warrior, breaching the walls of Paradis as the inheritor of the Attack titan, with the sole goal of sending the inhabitants of the island into chaos. Why should Marley waste its resources wiping out the devils on the island themselves when they could just make them destroy each other instead?"
"Eren suddenly finds himself back in time. Apparently it’s not the right universe because Mikasa and Armin died with the first break of the walls. Will he still choose to join the Survey Corps, or will he crumble under the second deaths of his best friends?"
"Rosetta, or Rose as her friends call her, has been in love with her best friend, Erwin Smith for almost a year now. But after Levi caught Erwin's attention, she's forced to accept that he'll never reciprocate her feelings. But someone else has been watching her on the sidelines as well.  And though he may not have had feelings for her in the beginning, he's beginning to think he might just develop them along the way. And maybe, along the way, she will too. The next works will be a collection of one-shots (in the sense that they can be read alone) but all are still connected. Just so if it turns out I can't continue this, it won't be hanging unfinished like my other fic. :'> This will be the introduction/prologue of sorts to the Mike/Rose(OFC) centric one-shots I'll be writing. I also might add another work for some one-shot interactions between her and the 104th because I've had a few daydreams about that too. And maybe in the future, I'll actually be able to piece everything together into one big story and have a grand plot because I already have a few bits and pieces of it in mind."
"In which Jean writes a letter to Marco"
"They found him in a hospital in that country, anonymous, half-conscious, barely alive - and they brought him home. But it's harder to readjust, especially with the weight of sixteen months of horror and guilt fresh on his mind. Levi hasn't broken yet - somehow - but he's so close. And maybe now that he's home, he can finally break."
"“ Absolutely not.” Levi declared. He crossed his arms. “Levi, I’m not asking. The Military Police need our help apprehending thieves in The Underground. Your expertise is essential in taking them down.” Erwin’s gaze was level. Even though Levi was standing and he was sitting, he was only slightly lower than the captain, and his icy blue eyes pierced Levi in a way that they rarely did.

"Everything about Conservator Operative Levi Ackerman is neat. His pinstripe suit, his tightly laced shoes and perfectly combed hair – jet black with a precise parting at the centre. His work is no exception. He is polite and inconspicuous. He corrects mistakes with little fuss, quietly returning lost house keys to their owners, smoothing creases in library books, and dismantling fire hazards. He smoothly morphs his dialect to blend in any era and location. Most importantly of all, he follows the rules. (Except sometimes. Because Erwin Smith.) An AU in which Time Traveller Levi is rather sick of his job, and even more sick of fighting his feelings for Erwin. The remaining chapters of this WIP will be posted when the fic is finished in its entirety!"

But when an impromptu trip into Captain Levi's past brings them closer than before, she can't help the feelings that begin to bubble up for her stoic captain. And it looks like he feels the same way.

"If Levi needs to push him away, he will let him have his space. If he needs to be angry at him, he will let him be angry, and soothe him so long as he allows it. But if he needs him to stay, he will not, because if he does, they will both regret it. And when they begin regretting, they begin resenting, and when they start resenting each other, then they will start losing each other. So tonight, all he can do is wait for him to come back.

"Levi isn't the one she truly wants and he knows it; they're good at using each other for other means. She think she's gotten away with it, until she runs into Eren on her way back. If she could change her mistakes, she would, but they're irreparable now. She can only hope that Eren doesn't find out what would certainly hurt him most."
"People always tell you to enjoy what you have, the bright yellow sunlight that bounced off your skin and radiated you in a beautiful orange light. The way the grass blades gracefully sway in the wind and pink azalea flowers that bloom and surround the big strong trees accompanied with heathy green colored leaves. But Levi couldn’t see any of it. All he saw was gray. Hundreds of gray hues. But never an ounce of color. Levi couldn’t decide if that was a curse or a blessing. What difference did it make?

"""Ever had iced tea, Mr. Levi?"" That finally got his attention. ""Iced tea? What the fuck is that?"""
"For Levihan Week 2021 Day 3: Sunsets A love story in eight sunsets."
"Canonverse snippets of life in survey corps. Each chapter is a stand-alone. Basically a place for me to store my head-canons, plot-bunnies and short fics. Varying length and genre. Anything can happen. Levi-centric but all my favourite characters will appear. Some chapters contain Eruri. More Eruri in later chaptes. --- I wrote these years ago after being sick for a long time. I lost most of my ability to write while being ill, these fics were written during my recovery as a way to practice and regain my ability to write. I have hundreds, the quality varies and some are only partially finished but I've finally mustered up the courage to post some of them."
"ALTERNATE TIMELINE: What if Eren hadn't gotten there to rescue Mikasa in time?"
"The end begins in the way it came."
"“What do you think about all the time we’ve spent together? - I wish it could go on and on forever. I’ll never get tired of being with you. - One should never say ‘never’. - It seems like we’re the annoying exception, then. ‘Cause I can say for sure that I’ll never get tired of you. Our love is just something else. - I like that thought. Share the rest of this life with me? - It would be an honour.”"
"You used to let me snort a line off your stomach. You used to love me so hard it hurt. Figuratively. Literally. Sometimes both. -- or: Falling out of love is easy. Stumbling back into each other's arms is hard."
"Y/N asks Zeke for the truth after months of not being in contact."
"Before Eren and Mikasa get married, Mikasa wants to find her father’s side of the family first, and like the supportive fiancé he is, Eren is there for her every step of the way. Of course, Eren never expected that he would end up falling in love with her much older cousin."
"Before Eren and Mikasa get married, Mikasa wants to find her father’s side of the family first, and like the supportive fiancé that he is, Eren is there for her every step of the way. But upon meeting her mysterious cousin, Eren’s world spirals out of control. He is thrown into the exhilarating chaos of Levi’s dark world, and becomes addicted to the unhindered freedom that he finds in every fight he gets into, unleashing his true self under Levi’s guidance. So Eren finds himself drowning in lies, after all, he was really not supposed to fall in love with his fiancée’s much older cousin."
"Being a Kirschtein means commanding the respect of the community, having the money to rub in people's faces, and possessing the intelligence to keep the family legacy thriving. And Jean wants absolutely nothing to do with that. Except maybe the respect. Legacy follows Jean, Marco and their friends as they stumble through college and different challenges for all of them. Between parental pressure, disease, awkwardness, and just shitty situations, these kids find love and bond together and learn to live for themselves and make their own future. A story with enough fluff to cushion the angst and humor to keep everyone sane in between."
"“It was rare. I was there. I remember it all too well.” It's been years ever since the magic of the titans is long gone. Revisiting past memories of the life she lived with an enigma that is Eren Jaeger had never been this hard for Mikasa Ackerman. Loving him was nothing but red, and yet every time, they both still foolishly wished for the ending to change what could've been."
"Eren has travel back five years and now he can fix the opportunity he missed to find his father as well as the truth behind his disappearance. So, it's time to take a different path. Cue the action music! This one's in for a fun adventure! Time for a story of self discovery, fun-loving quests, dangerous adventures, deep-bonded friendship, cryptic messages, deep secrets, thrilling mysteries, and so much more! but things aren't so sunshine and rainbows with Eren as the deeper he dives, the less he is to return. But he can't back out now, not when he's so close and accomplished so much. Maybe it's time to rely on others for a- nope, there he goes. Nevermind, Eren's too stubborn to rely on anyone. Or maybe..? Wait! did he just die!? Jesus Christ"
"Eren has travel back five years and now he has fix what he couldn't before. That being said, why are so many people sticking to his side? It's not like he did magic, which he now knows how to use. Why are they so surprised? Why is Mikasa hating on her cousin? Why won't Zeke leave? Why is a short scary captain so adamant on his safety? Okay, maybe Eren changed much more than he realize."
"three years after the rumbling, the outside world ambassadors return to what used to be their home.  with the visit full of surprises and fresh beginnings, they return to marley with newfound bonds.  but, with tensions running high with the jaegerists of paradis, wounds are torn open once again.  the phantom pains of a past life threaten to destroy a lifelong dream."
"The Cadet Corps Training Program lasts three years. Though there are exceptions, individuals begin the course at 12, and shall be prepared to take one of the three pathways at 15. A person can change a lot in that time. Particularly at the tender age of adolescence. Updates whenever I can."
"Comfort is just another form of healing, and Jean is determined to keep him happy till the end."
"A kiss. A betrayal. How will Levi react?"
"Armin runs away from home, leaving behind a farewell letter and a diary, later found by his friends. But will this be enough to find him and bring him back home?"
"When he was ten, Levi Ackerman lost his parents. His uncle Kenny and his daughters were the only family he had left, albeit not much of a good one. Now he's 23 and he decides to finish his senior year, something a famous boy with the name Eren Jaeger decides too, after the many tours he's done. The fans at his feet make Levi disgusted even though he used to admire the boy not long ago. But what will happen when Eren announces he wants to hold a contest for a new partner on his next journey of song? ·Title may change·"
"I write a lot of monologues a lot lately.. Stupid drabbles, agh. I like the idea of both Petra's and Auruo's love being unrequited. No happy endings here..."
"Now with added Jean's POV as a second chapter. I changed the title because I've just realized there's a tanyart fic with the same title and I felt like a dork - I'm sorry, I'm terrible at naming things. For a prompt on the SNK kink meme - Jean fucking Eren in a shitty black wig and the both of them pretending it makes Eren look like Mikasa. Somewhere in my brain it short-circuited with some of my own old issues and the result is this. Eren will try to make things good for Jean, despite everything. But it seems he doesn't need to try too hard, after all."
"Monsters weren't made to love, after all."
"Levi was trying to protect them both by not letting Eren in, but Eren only sees Levi's unwillingness to open his heart. He silently hopes Levi would say something because Eren is giving up on him."
"Sequel to the ""LOVE THY ENEMY"" story (can be read separately, though). Rosemarie Romy Sohner is assigned to guard one of the most important prisoners - Bertholdt Hoover. Her former comrade and friend is kept in the Underground prison... and his chances look quite grim. What can be done about his situation? Romy will have to choose between her mind and her heart."

"The space didn’t matter even a bit- still doesn’t- after all, I’m still thinking about that boy even now. The space between a touch is irrelevant."
"Small connected oneshots with father!Levi and mother!reader. Not necessarily in chronological order... Or.... Y/n and Jean might have been a thing during their cadet days but it's been two years since Jean decided to break it off. As Jean approaches Y/n again with the hope they can be together now that humanity is free he is  taken aback by learning she's happily married to and already has a kid with none other than their Corporal, Levi. ~this is indeed a Levi x reader. i just figured an ex relationship of Y/n's past could give some more angst and a bit drama to the plot I'm going for~"
"Ymir falls first. Historia falls later. But no matter what, they still find each other."
"woohoo, it's the horse riding au that nobody wanted! i don't even know what to say about this. Contains horses, tight trousers, lots of leather, copious swearing, shouting in German, and a lot of Arctic Monkeys."
"Bertholdt's been having nightmares as his second appearance as the colossal titan nears. Reiner does what he can to calm his nerves. Or, Reiner and Bertl's up-until-then ambiguous relationship turns certified Something More(™) after some very sweaty late-night fondling."
"The title was inspired by one of the songs from my favorite group's newest Christmas album. There might be some mistakes, please let me know about. Thank you for reading and please enjoy. (^^)"
"Eren and Levi reconcile after the events on the rooftop."
"Five times Historia's mind turned to memories of the woman she had loved, and one time Ymir's could not."
"(Modern AU) Levi Ackerman had only the vaguest memory of his mother. Years later, he decides to visit the unmarked grave that he always pretended was special, was hers. But for the first time ever, there was someone else there: a child with haunting eyes and a patchwork scarf. He finds much to his surprise that he doesn't mind her quick presence--even if she could never possibly understand the loss he felt. The loss he'd never admit either. Oneshot/drabble"
"The blood would never wash off, it never did. No matter how long or how hard he tried, his hands would always be stained with blood."
"The world around Levi finally caves in completely. It's all disappearing bit by bit, scream by scream right before his eyes and this time even he is not fast enough to save everyone. His only option, only way to stop the world from hurling into an abyss is holding it on his own shoulders, by becoming the very thing he hates, the very thing he needs to destroy."
"I really must be getting old. I let out a hollow chuckle to the empty room. Waking up early has its merits. At least none of these brats will see me like this. It’s better that they see me as the invincible hero that I’m known as; not this tired, broken old man. Takes place in the current manga timeline; possible spoilers."
"Bertholdt had always had nightmares, but Reiner would always be there for him, right?"
"Armin is a pain at parties. He doesn't even like them very much. But he comes all the same, because it's nice to be with Eren and it's nice to get plastered and doing both is even better."
"Actions speak a lot louder than words - that was a saying that you and the Captain lived by, for sure. As Levi’s personal assistant, you showed the whole world just how much he meant to you through little actions and meticulous gestures, accommodating for every one of his needs and quirks while making it seem effortless. All the while, Levi was oblivious to it all. He didn’t notice that his work was getting finished earlier, that he was sleeping more hours, that he was finally eating every meal of the day. His life was just better with you by his side. But all this changed when you were promoted. Levi no longer had someone to make his perfect cup of tea, or run around HQ dropping off papers and setting the most efficient schedule. You had a squad to look after, and Levi had a new (less than substantial) assistant. Realising just how much you did for him might have come too late as the both of you learn how distance really does make the heart grow fonder."
"Levi Ackerman has no idea why every time it rains, he feels really, really miserable. He didn't expect his new neighbor who has just moved in next to his apartment to show him the reason, either. Like literally. Or, just one more Reincarnation fic for the OTP."
"Really, Eren expected this relationship to go to hell. Living in a world filled with titans causes one to understand that Death could be around any corner. It's just, Eren did not expect Death to hit him, or rather Bertholdt, in this specific way. Nor did Eren expect to be betrayed by the one person that should have never betrayed him."
"eruri. angst. in which love letters are only sent and received between erwin and levi after one becomes a member of the dearly departed."
"As a young child, Eren had always dreamed about joining his heroes and fighting to protect innocent civilians. That dream has been all but crushed as Eren can barely able to afford college, let alone the thousands of dollars it would cost to get his powers registered. But when he meets a man whose touch alone soothes the aching fire within him, can Eren find the determination and hope to become the hero he was born to be?"
"“I have little left in myself -- I must have you. The world may laugh -- may call me absurd, selfish -- but it does not signify. My very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly vengeance on its frame.” -Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre Levi grew up in a world consumed by romance, longing to one day feel that same sensation in his heart. Once he finds that special person, he is convinced that fate dictates their destiny to be together, and presents himself with the duty to achieve that future. In his misshapen mindset, this is what love is. -Previously called ""Ally of Sin""- DISCLAIMER: I do not own Attack on Titan or its characters."
"A ridiculous rhyme I just spun to be the overarching title for this collection of fics written for Jeanmarco Month 2017. Numerous aus, some canon, lots of fluff, probably a healthy helping of angsty so your teeth don't rot. A whole lotta Jeanmarco in an itty bitty living space. That's what you'll find here."
"JeanMarco Month, Day 1 (June 7): Reunion/Fate (Zombie Apocalypse AU, ""Survey Corpse"") In the course of only a few days, the world as Jean Kirschtein and his friends knew completely fell apart. The dead don't stay dead--and worst of all, that includes Jean's little sister Ella. Now Jean must try to survive and avoid the smothering guilt he feels, and the only person he trusts is a kid named Marco. But Marco has his own issues himself...just not in the same way Jean does."
"When she looked back, she could remember him from the funeral. He had not stood out back then, not like the weeping woman walking just behind the casket, too young to have lost a son. Not like the woman walking beside her with a small child in her arms - one, that she would hopefully never have to bury."
"JeanMarco Month, Day 4 (June 10): Modern Day AU After a night of drinking and talking, Marco Bodt and his best friend Jean move onto deeper conversations...as in romance. And the thing that Marco wishes most of all right now is that he could be brave enough to tell him how he really felt. Oneshot/drabble"
"After Bertholdt's death, he finds himself where he least expected. In the midst of his emotional turmoil, a familiar face appears before him. *Based on a piece of fan art that I found and cried over *"
"SnK AU in which Marco and Jean live a relatively peaceful life together, battling insecurities."
"Eren realised he was different since his early childhood. He didn't know different how... just different, not that it mattered much to him, as much as it seemed to confuse everyone else. Though he never anticipated exactly how much more confusing everything could become until Levi came into the mix. (aka Eren has no clue how to deal with his queer feelings, or even how to begin to figure himself out when it comes to what he feels for Levi.)"
"Losing Petra and his Squad deeply affected the infamous Captain, but how does he cope when he starts seeing her again?"
"You see the date on his wrist says the 3rd of April 2035, but the date right now is the 4th of April 2035. Jean Kirstein was supposed to die yesterday."
"Eren is dying. A harsh fact that the survey corps would have to come to terms with."
"Problem child Eren Jaeger meets his match when Levi moves in next door. The two youngsters find friendship quickly and go through the ups and downs in a world of Alphas, Betas, and Omegas. An Alpha and Omega set of best friends includes its own plethora of struggles and misunderstandings. Tested with the trials of growing up, they find joy in the darkness and learn that there is no better sanctuary than in one another."
"Shiganshina, a district abandoned by the monarchy after the Fall of Maria, was expected to fade and decay, along with all it's people. But three children refused to die- even if survival costs their humanity. Eren Jaeger finds himself struggling for sanity in the face of his mother's death; Mikasa Ackerman simply wants to hold her tattered family together. And Armin Arlert's plans may mean the salvation, or demise, of all mankind. Alternate Continuum/ AU- Canon Divergence ON HOLD indefinitely, though I’m not going to say abandoned, because that would break my heart; I do hope to finish this some day, but that day is not currently within sight)"
"Eren's a mildly depressed teen just starting college. Levi is his lecturer. Thanks to the past, Eren can't accept happiness. No, he hates himself too much for that, but Levi keeps sticking his nose in and Eren doesn't understand what the man really wants. Eren's POV"
"Levi rushes to the wall in the aftermath of the Armored and Colossal Titans' attack. “Are you worried about your wife?” The question shocked him out of his musings. Levi looked up, “My what?” But the pastor was already speaking, “You’re obviously beside yourself with stress – and it’s understandable. Not knowing if your wife has survived-” Levi cut him off, “My what?” The pastor hesitated, apparently realizing he’d made some mistake, but misunderstanding precisely what it was. “Your…wife? The woman we traveled with before? She’s ah – forceful. You two uh – have the same, er – strident personality. When we first met, she dangled me off the wall.”"
"A collection of drabbles following Eren and Mikasa's relationship through various scenarios."
"Engagement rings tend to lose their meanings."
"Levi feels alone."
"Levi is leaving. Based off the prompt ""I don't hate you. I never could hate you. That's the problem."""
"Out of all the things Eren Jaeger had expected to be in his adult life, haunted was not one of them. And yet. He drew the covers up to his chin as if they'd protect him from whatever was clanging around in his new apartment, trying not to yell out loud. He'd never been so terrified before, not even when he'd had to kill those two thugs to save his sister. At least he'd known what those thugs were like an how to attack them, but a ghost—? He considered calling Mikasa or Armin for help, but then he remembered that they were miles away. Even if Armin did come up with a plan, Eren would be dead already. Joy. How do you escape a ghost anyway? Maybe I can make it to the fire escape before it gets to me, he thought, grimly, as he straightened up. He didn't particularly want to see what it looked like, he just wanted to get the hell out of here before— ""Boo."" ""AAAAAARGHHH!"" He screamed, closing his eyes and lashing out as hard as he could. ""Oof! Ouch, kid, what the fuck?"" // Or the one in which Levi is a ghost and Eren is trying not to fall in love."
"Everyone has their 'one that got away'. For Levi Ackerman, it was Eren Jaeger. Levi never meant to hurt the love of his life. And now with Eren gone, Levi doubted he could survive without the boy. Fast forward to five years, the two cross paths again. Levi realized he could mend things with his lost lover but that wasn't going to be easy. Eren was a very much changed man now with a beautiful future waiting for him that did not include Levi. However, Levi wasn't one to give up easily. He would make Eren fall for him again. Or atleast, he'd die trying."
"I stay long after everyone as left, long after the fire has smoldered out and drenched the field in darkness.  I sit down finally, and pull my knees up to my chest.  I have no idea how long I've been out here and I'm so close I should be able to feel the residual heat of the embers, but nothing touches my chilled skin."
"Each chapter explores the prompts provided by the hosts of AoT Week 2k17! Each chapter also has a new pairing and none of the chapters are connected/follow the same storyline."
"Title says it all. (tags added as the chapter goes up) Springles: Ch 1 Eremika: Ch 2 Jeanmarco: Ch 3"

"Levi and Erwin worked hard to preserve their relationship. But when it comes to it, would Erwin fight for him? Or was Levi just fighting a lonely battle on his own?"

"Levi and Eren have a deep attraction for each other, and they're willing to risk almost anything to be together. The only trouble is, with Eren's Titan powers being so difficult to control, are they heading for disaster? And when everything is torn apart, how will each of the characters cope with grief and loss?"

"“He’s so tall and handsome as hell, he’s so bad but he does it so well.” Erwin Smith is the richest and most well-known bachelor of his time. What with his dashingly good looks and a body that rivals that of Adonis, he could bend anyone to his will.

"After 2000 years and 4 reincarnations, it really did seem like time for humanity to finally win. For Levi, he just wanted to have his imagined future with Eren, he never wanted to be left with just a mixtape and memories."
"Ever wondered what a modern AU where Erwin Smith is head of a funeral home would look like? WELL LOOK NO FURTHER! This might sound twisted/funny. And I assure you it will be twisted, and it might even be funny from time to time. But there will be violence, smut etc. etc. at later chapters. You have been warned. Erwin is the head of the funeral home the Titan's Rest, he has recently recruited Levi who is acting as an assisstant of sorts to him. They are called in to get a body from the morgue. More exactly: the body of Carla Jäger."
"“You did everything you could,” I say through the lump in my throat. My breathing is still labored and unnatural from nearby spirits wandering their way away from the flaming building. His tears drop into his lap as he shakily sighs, “This is only the beginning,” he sniffs, “There are much, much worse things coming.” -or- After a lifetime of seeing ghosts, Jean isn't scared by much. That is until he's damned with a prophecy that the world is going to end. What's he supposed to do about it? Who knows. But hopefully whoever this Marco Bodt is that everyone keeps talking about will have an answer or two."

He’s dying to find out more, his judgment getting the better side of him. He may uncover truths that he wishes he hadn’t. They do say that curiosity killed the cat."
"MAJOR SPOILERS! This is what was going through Hannes's mind before he was killed by the Smiling Titan. This was written by my brother, it is his first thing he's ever written. Feel free to review!"
"Being in the Survey Corps was a death wish. Only those who were skilled enough to survive could fight against the titans, yet the heart of those soldiers are heavy. The man or woman standing next to you yesterday could be gone in an instant today. However, those lost will always linger among the tenebrous skies."
"Eren's a kid who would happily spend all his time in his wolf form. He loved the forest, he loved exploring, but most he loved napping in the sun. That was until a strange kid shows up out of nowhere, in his spot nonetheless, and Eren starts experiencing all sorts of things that leave him questioning just who he is. Lovelies, art is now up.

He doesn't know why he looked for his father and found him, why he watches him go about his mundane life from his hiding place. Sometimes he wonders what kind of life he could have if he were a Marleyan. Not a half-Marleyan, not an honorary Marleyan, but a real one. Would he be happier? Would he be a better person? Would he be a good brother to his siblings?"

"""I'm glad,"" Eren croaks out, pulling away with tears in his eyes. He stares at Levi for a moment, never taking his hands off his shoulders, before he continues. ""I'm glad you were all okay."" It's Levi's turn to swallow, now. He pushes Eren against the bed, holds himself above him, before he leans down for a kiss. ""Me too, brat."""

"It was a beautiful day to die."
"It felt like it was too long since he had last seen Erwin. Things had definitely changed since then."
"""corporal,"" eren breathes, always careful with his tone because this was humanity's most formidable he was talking to. levi had every tactic, technique and whim under his belt to eliminate almost everything, including eren in his human state, but then, this has always been them - two rocks on opposite ends of thin ice. if either of them were to move even one centimeter, what they have holding them up would break. eren would rather not take that risk and it seems clear that levi has no intent on budging. ""i miss the rest."""

Now a chance meeting with a certain brilliant blond has put him in the position of keeping his feelings hidden once again. Will this time be any different? Can he risk that it won't? Its not right... After all I went through to get away from this back home, after all the trouble I caused... and now i'm doing it again? its not right for me to think of him that way. to put that pressure on him even in my head. to imagine doing that to him. it doesn't matter how i feel, i won't let you get hurt because of it, even if it means our status will remain as friends."
"The thought that he would never see Mike again was painful, there was no denying it. That smell, though, was at least of some comfort to Erwin, clinging to the pillows and the sheets, set deep into the bed itself. A tragic-romance drabble written for EruMike Week on Tumblr"

"I'm taking requests! The fandoms I am willing to fulfill requests for are posted in the fandoms section above. I will write just about any ship, with the exception of Voltron ships including Matt. I would love to write about Matt but I feel as though I haven't learned enough about him as a character yet. Sorry! As for the other fandoms, I will write just about any ship (companion-companion or companion-Sole surivor for Fallout 4 are both ok). I'll write just about anything and I should probably add that I'm incredibly familiar with every episode of Avatar, have played the entirety of Fallout 4, and am up to speed on The 100, Voltron, Attack on Titan, and Supernatural. Please try to keep the requests short and sweet, but don't be afraid to ask for what you want! I will post each request-fulfillment as soon as I am able. Thanks! :) Note: If you need to get an idea of my writing style, check out some of my other works before submitting a request.

"Eren blames himself for what has happened to his captain's squad, so he takes off and self mutilated himself. But Levi comes along and stops Eren from doing anything more reckless. He shows Eren thst he is not a monster and tries to give his brat the reassurance that he desperately needs."

"A Shadowhunters AU with ya fav boys. With Jean, a high warlock from Brooklyn and Marco, a shadowhunter back in town after training in other Institutes abroad. Currently working together to fight a group of rogue shadowhunters and demons. You'd think that's already hard but hey guess what these two had a thing once and, well, you know how it is. Marco, for all his advanced training, apparently can't give 100% because he is still hung up on Jean (who wouldn't tbh) and wants closure. Jean keeps saying its nbd and that should've settled things but he went from doing the good guys a few favors to being a regular on the team and constantly worrying about Marco's safety so what's the deal, my boy?"

"The sky is tar-black, no remnants of cocktail-blue left, and for all I know that color may never grace it again. The instrument in my frozen fist beeps in terror, but I can barely hear it over the roar of thunder. I want to fall to my knees but my muscles are too tense, too numb from the cold. Who knew Jean Kirschtein would die on a Jinae beach in the middle of summer, watching the end of the world at twenty four years old? I sure fucking didn't. It’s a shit way to go."

"“It was an accident.” “It may have started that way.” Armin says, dipping one of his fries into the ketchup idly. “But we both know that's not what it is now.” “I just. I'm destroying everything. If I give them what they want- they lose.” “Let them lose.” Armin said, eyes serious. “If loving you is a loss, as you're so sure it is. Let them lose."" // In other words, Eren's mind is a very, very dark place."

From the 11th chapter on are my work, please look into there other works! Enjoy! Eren Yeager, a young male omega, has lived most of his life in peaceful contentment, until he's kidnapped from the streets and sold into the omega slave trade. Lost, alone, and fighting for his life, he knows very little of what will happen next. When he meets his new master, a wealthy alpha by the name of Levi, his world is flipped upside down as he struggles to fight his innermost desires."
"Eren Jaeger, a typical young man, wakes up to find himself in a unfamiliar world, after getting into a fight with a stranger in his home. To make matters even more complicated, the eight girls from a Bishoujo game, his sister gave him, are there too and they all keep hinting at liking him. Which wouldn't be a problem, if he wasn't completely and totally gay."
"What is and what could be."
"An experiment with bondage doesn't quite work out as planned...."
"Levi had been dreaming of a man. A priest, whom he helps battle against monsters and creatures only found in fairy tales. He always dies. Levi can never save him. One day, he walks into a bookstore and sees the man he had only been dreaming of for months. Erwin had also been dreaming. He dreams of a half vampire who he saved from certain death. The half vampire also awoken something in him, something that he was certain he would never feel since becoming a priest. He saw him, running out of his bookstore and he felt that part of him awaken again. Can true love survive this time around, or are these two men destined to live through the same fate over and over again?"
"On an expedition outside of Wall Rose, things mostly went well, except for one thing. Levi went missing. There is some hope that he is still alive since they could not find his horse or 3DMG, but hope is wearing thin as time passes."
"Images flashed before his eyes... Something not a part of his current reality; however, they felt to him like missing pieces of a distant past. ...And then of course he remembered the day the 104th training squad's newly-graduated trainees joined the Survey Corps. Amongst the groups of toughened teens strong-willed enough to join the Survey Corps, one stood out to Levi. It was a young brat, with the most indescribably bright, colourful eyes ever - eyes that told Levi he had seen things, seen many things - and messy, chocolate brown hair. He stood in the salute, proud and resolved, anger mixed with only the tiniest traces of fear. His face shining with hope and determination that Levi soon learned would continue on, even in the most dire of moments. --- ""I haven't found anyone except for you because I hadn't been looking. And I don't intend to."" Levi said that with a tone of finality in his voice, and Hanji took the hint. He had fully intended to keep things that way. But sometimes, life (be it your first or your hundredth) wanted to screw around with you. So obviously, he would have to find others."
"Before Levi dies, he asks to see the frozen lake"
"It was the shadows in his eyes that separated him from the rest. It's the walls around himself that made him unreachable even just from plain sight. It was the way he holds himself, the silent scream for help in the late hours that I saw how much he needed help. The shattered pieces of himself that he was holding in his scarred, bleeding hands, the shattered pieces of himself that I wanted to fix. Not to return it back to how it was before, but make it into something much, much more beautiful, filling in the lost shards with the love that I could give. He wore scars all over his body and soul, like tattoos on his skin, scars from all the battle he has won. And in my sight, it was his scars that made him beautiful."
"A terrible accident lands 18 year old Eren Jaeger in West Trost  mental institution where he meets his cold and mysterious room mate, Levi who refuses to open up at all what so ever to Eren. Who knew that this ill tempered man would become such an important part of his new life in the ward. Rating changes to explicit starting on chapter 11!"
"Levi has some doubts about this new plan, but Eren is there to help."
"There was once a pact between dragon and king in the northern kingdom where dragons lived at peace with human and creature alike. Alas, peace did not last and the old ways were lost to greed and power. King Grisha and his father before him waged war on the dragons, with no regard for hatchlings or old ones alike, and slayed them remorselessly for their hides. Though the dragons fought back fiercely and took as many and more mortal lives in retaliation, they were too few to withstand the tenacity of human beings. Only a handful remain, living in fear and in disgrace, existing in a world that has no place left for them. When the heir apparent, Eren Jaeger, is brought to the scaled witch in the briar wood to beg for his life, a new pact is formed. Levi, one of the last living dragons of legend, offers to spare Eren’s life in return for his promise to be a fair, just, and selfless king. But Eren grew into a selfish, arrogant, righteously angry young man now bent on revenge for the murder of his mother. Eren does not deserve the life Levi had so graciously given him, but there’s an honesty in him that is unmistakable. Maybe knowing his heart is not his own will change him. And maybe Levi will change with him."
"I skipped straight to day 6 of Rivetra week because I am really not in the right mindset to write the prompt for day 5 today. I'll go back and get to it tomorrow, but today you get this one. It is sad, it is angsty. I'm proud of it despite the way I had to feel in order to write it. I hope you all enjoy."
"On the verge of death, they both regret what could have been but was never. But there is always an afterlife. Eremika oneshot with slight Jearmin."
"Reiner has a secret.  Well, Reiner, Bertholt, and Annie have a secret but only Reiner has a problem.  After the death of Marcel, Reiner does more than lose his mind; he begins to lose his dynamic. The more Reiner struggles with the loss of Marcel, the guilt over his actions, and the personae he must wear, the more his alpha dynamic weakens.  And that's a problem since only titan shifters present with a dynamic and Reiner's altering dynamic is dangerously close to blowing their cover. Faced with losing his best friend, Bertholt makes the decision to take Marcel's place as Reiner's anchor to remind Reiner that he is both a warrior and an alpha and to keep their mission intact.  All he has to do is submit. tl;dr: canon-compliant light ABO in which titan shifters can alter their dynamic with a little sexual encouragement."
"After a mission goes wrong, Mikasa feels a familiar power awaken within her from years ago. Only this time it seems to form an inexplicable connection between her and Captain Levi, leaving them to question themselves and the name of Ackerman."
"Levi, vulnerable. It’s like watching the rain fall up instead of down."

"You work for an agency called the Survey Corps. It's one goal is to defeat the Titans. You are one of the strongest spies to ever work there. Everything was going well until you were partnered with him. Levi Ackerman. When you were in training a few years ago, your friend threw a party. Levi was also there. Things happened and it ended up with you and Levi hooking up. You hadn't seen each other for several years, but no you have to work together on an important mission. WARNING: SWEARING AND MATURE CONTENT I do not own any of the characters from Attack on Titan"
"The moment Emalina Varlen loses her parents when Shiganshina fell, she decides to join the military in order to become strong. There she meets Jean Kirschtein and instantly there's a connection between the two. But one wants to join the Military Police while the other the Survey Corps. How will these two fare if they choose different regiments? Mainly, how will they survive this cruel world without each other?"
"Our love wasn't enough to keep everything in tact, to glue and piece back fragments of what we used to be the way it was before the fallout. The palace that we spent years on making was turning to dust while we slip farther away from each other."
"Wordless Armin drabble, he thinks about the stars."

"Fresh out of college, Eren is a young doctor, whose main challenge is to top his girlfriend Mikasa, an MMA fighter, at least as good as she does it to him. At the same time, Armin has the feeling that his life will be turned around, and he has no idea why. Story that starts with a conversation between two friends in a coffee shop and ends..... Well, who am I to say? **DISCONTINUED**"
"Most of them are in high school. The one's who are not find out this information rather late. **DISCONTINUED**"
"Levi is working the counter at the Chibitan Bubble Tea Shoppe when a tall, blond hunk in a tan peacoat walks by and does a doubletake straight out of a Marx Brothers comedy. Levi stares back, furious, because it isn’t Erwin. Klaus continues to stare, forlorn, because it isn’t Taki. [This can be read stand-alone or as a sequel to my other fic, Just Bounce One in the Dirt]"
"One-hundred-and-four shippy drabbles for the soul."
"It is dusk when they come home for the first time. He will remember this for the rest of his life. Petra is wearing a yellow dress, and there are white flowers in her hair. Her eyes are bright, and a little swollen because she cried when he said his vows to her. But her cheeks are flushed from laughing; she has laughed more today than he’s ever heard, and he is drunk on the sound of it. || an epilogue"
"Eren is sobbing in his truck because he failed an important test in one of his college classes, which is causing him to fail the said class. Levi is currently on a jog, but see's the sobbing person, and well, Levi has always been way too nosy for his own good."
"This was everything they feared; now, Wall Rose would come down. Eren was their only hope. But with the lack of Survey Corps members, Mikasa's over-protectiveness and Levi slowly drifting away from him: he's going to have trouble living up to that expectation."
"Sometimes, if you can believe it, Eren feels like he can fly."
"Hundreth times of hello and so on, i was born to find you and being complete. Prompt fic for Eren's birthday."
"Armin Arlert had never loved a man more than he loved Eren. It was impossible, it wasn't fathomable. His heart belonged to Eren. That is until Eren ripped it from his chest and took it with him upon leaving for his 'mission'. Armin had to move on, he absolutely had to. Yet whatever he did to try and move on, it never worked."
"Petra was the one person who Oluo couldn’t imagine his life without. Petra was the one person Oluo needed."
"Levi's life is falling apart and he doesn't know how to fix it. He lost everything and he lost everyone. The only person he would have trusted his life with had been taken away from him."
"“You know that I love you, Eren..” Levi whispered, squeezing the boy in his arms with a forceful hug, though it only made him cry harder. He knew exactly what the captain was to say, and he was not prepared to hear it in the slightest. “But, we can’t be together.”"
"It's painful, it's lonely- he's gone. Levi remembers, feels everything. That touch, that voice, that laugh."
"Whether the scars will tear us apart or bring us closer together, we will always be connected to them, no matter what."
"""I was a complete fool to fall in love with you at the very first sight."""

"Armin waits, clinging to a Promise. Because after all, that's all they have left"
"Jean is good at hiding things from other people. When the new kid in town, Marco, decides to insert himself in Jean's life, it's like he has no walls anymore. Expect a lot of teenager shenanigans, angry lesbians, confused feelings, ""close calls"" and a robot dog?"
"Rosalie Turner was homesick. After the loss of her home and separation from her father, all she wanted was a little normalcy. But normalcy isn't what you get when you live in a world filled with man-eating giants, or when your friend can turn into one of said giants and go on a rampage. So with nowhere else to turn, she joins the Survey Corps and goes along for the ride."
"In which Mikasa's version of an unhealthy coping mechanism consists of making out with Jean every night while Eren is across the ocean in Marley."
"Jean is a lighthouse, but he is crumbling beneath the waves and he cannot hold Eren forever."
"""What?"" he asked, his voice trembling with emotion Eren will never probably understand. The kind of emotion you learn to feel with time, time Eren did not have. But he could say what he felt now, or at least try to. ""I always wanted to matter, always wanted to leave my mark here.. some kind of constant reminder to numerous generations that would follow. And now I did. I saved us. All of us. But I still feel so empty and worthless"" he fixed Levi with his gaze. The captain looked no less confused and frightened than before. Good, that's just how Eren felt about him. A story about happiness and sorrow, confusion and understanding, love and fear -and two men who conquered all of it."
"Mikasa relishes in her newfound sense of freedom. Loneliness does not mean she is alone. A prequel and sequel to Home and I Know (I Am the One in Love)."
"It had been 2am when Erwin awoke to the sound of Levi’s quiet sobs and sniffles, hand covering his mouth in attempt to silence his cries. His body shook, though Erwin’s arm steadied him, circled around his waist, nose pressed into his soft black hair. Levi had been having nightmares recently, conjuring up some old, unwanted memories, things he would have rather kept in the back of his mind."
"Rising in popularity, the band No Name takes some time to convalesce after their most recent tour.  Levi finds himself battling his demons and exhaustion at a beach side Bed and Breakfast that is closed for the off-season.  The only drawback to his self-imposed solitude?  The property's caretaker, Erwin, an obnoxious dick who seems to want nothing more than piss Levi off.  But Erwin has some demons of his own.  The more time Levi spends at the coastal town, and around Erwin, the more he thinks that maybe Erwin may not be such a dick, but badly damaged.  Either way, Levi is struggling to keep his distance, even if the rational part of his mind protests vehemently.  Can these two broken souls put each other back together again? **Please mind updated rating and tags as of 5/20/21"

"Mikasa returns home after months of being away and the loneliness of her apartment eats her away."
"Levi is a beta. That’s what everyone around him thinks, because Levi has been suppressing his omega-dynamic with illegal suppressants from the Underground for as long as he’s been able to. Even when Erwin recruits him into the Survey Corps, a corps that accepts and embraces omegas without questioning, Levi keeps his dynamic a secret. It’s all fine, really. It works and nobody suspects a thing, until Levi loses all he’s ever had and starts slipping endlessly. He only finds consolidation in the arms of his commander, Erwin Smith, but is Levi ready to open up? Time will tell."
"Levi had been living on the streets for going-on four years. After seeing a large circus tent pitched just to the side of his usual hangout areas, he becomes oddly intrigued with the idea of visiting, and suddenly, he's faced with the decision of running away with the circus, or continuing his miserable life alone in the streets."

"Eren contracts Hanahaki disease after a tragic falling out with Levi"
"Levi and Hanji deal with the corp's latest loss (Spoilers for chapter 105) “The kids,” she said - though she knew, she knew - they weren’t. Not anymore. “They’ve lost so much. We’ve all lost so much.” And now Sasha. Sasha. Hanji still couldn’t reconcile her memory of the bright, energetic young woman with the reality of the still, silent figure laid out below. When the wind picked up, Levi spoke. “I won’t lose you too.” As a statement, it was simple, straightforward, impossibly candid. Below, Connie sat with Sasha’s broken body. In her experience, a gentle lie was infinitely worse than a cruel truth, and so she said, “You might.” The hand on her leg reflexively squeezed."
"""Hey, Eren, go see the ocean. I'll be with you forever and everywhere."""
"If given the chance, most people want to repeat one moment. Whether to change the outcome, relive the memory or some other stupid reason. Jean wanted none of that, wanted to get over anything and everything concerning Marco Bodt. But fate, per usual, didn't seem to give two shits about what he wanted. Really, he should’ve known better than to hope this time would be different."

Others...are not so lucky. Others can't remember the reason to hold on. They can't remember the reason to keep trying. Reason never matters. It's a break-up. Everyone involved are guilty of running away."
"Levi called it quits to his and Eren's relationship years ago, leaving Eren's heart shattered and those feelings in the past. It just takes one fateful encounter to reignite old flames and bring those feelings back."

"Armin was hallucinating again. It had been three years, and he thought he had gotten over this, but with the terror and trauma of the 59th Expedition only dubbed ""the incident,"" everything came rushing back. The Corporal is his only hope - a whirlwind of anxiety, release and sex - but things have become complicated and using his body seems to be the only way out. If that was what he had to do to forget, to keep his ever-running mind from running itself into the ground, then he'd do it. He had to be useful, yearned for it, because a titan wouldn’t spare its next meal just because it was smart."
"For a moment, he meets Eren’s eyes. They size each other up, or check each other out, Levi can’t tell."
"Everyone bears marks. Guilt, pain, and regret dripping from their hands like the blood of their friends and the tears they cannot cry. In the end, they are only human. **ON HIATUS**"

Eren is born as a cursed child, his eyes two different colours. One is a vibrant green, greener than emerald and just as beautiful as one while the other is a blinding yellow, nearly as bright as the sun.

Eren Yeager wants Levi to quit dating his best friend but things don't work out that way. Who really controls the titans and why are they so bent on revenge?  You will find out by the end of this story. *  I hope you enjoy this fanfic based on the characters from the Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan) series.

"Bertholdt had many regrets in his life, but being with the two of them was certainly not one of them. Set in different AU's. Some drabbles may coincide with others."
"He didn’t know how to name it. He didn’t know what it was. What they were to each other. or how they became Lovers in the end."
"She was a beautiful flower whom no one knew was silently dying on the inside. Always cheery and always bright, there was a dark side to Eren Jaeger that no one really knew about until one night her upperclassman and ex-thug Levi Zoe-Smith finds this broken smiling girl asleep in the alley behind his parents' restaurant dressed in a short dress unbecoming of the snow landing on her prone form. Can he become the man she needs and help her out of the pit she's been tossed in? Or will she rot before he even gets a foot into her heart."
"""I must have met you hundreds of times by now...and every single time, I've had to watch you die."" After losing Eren during humanity's last stand against the Titans, Levi finds himself thrust back in time to his days in the underground. With no idea as to what triggered this phenomena, or what the source of this mysterious power is, Levi is confused but determined to make this second chance count. Things don't go as planned however, and before he realizes it, he's trapped himself in a seemingly endless time loop. At first, his goal is to save humanity no matter what the personal cost. Meeting Eren over and over again, only to lose him every single time wasn't part of his mission though, and with every reset, Levi finds himself gaining more and more regrets. Eventually, Levi has to ask himself what his goal really is. Is it humanity's freedom, or saving Eren?"
"It's been four years since Jean was forced to cut off all ties with Marco, his best friend and boyfriend. Since then, he's been forced into 'gay cure' camps, religious services and home schooling. After moving away from home and living on his own for two years, Jean bumps into Marco again, away from the supervision of his strict parents in, of all places, a laundrette. Is Jean capable of righting the wrongs that happened back in high school, or will his embarrassment and avoidance win out right and preventing him of ever fixing things with Marco? 'And I remember when I met him. It was so clear that he was the only one for me. We both knew right away. And as the years went on things got more difficult, We were faced with more challenges.'"
"Through many lifetimes, Levi and Erwin's destinies have been interwoven, and finally, they meet again as people. Levi is a 17-year-old high school student. Erwin is an 18-year-old university student studying overseas."
"Eren Jeager isn't your average vampire hunter. He is the only known person to survive after being bitten by a wild vampire. Because of the assault on him, he is now immune to all of the vampire tricks, such as mind control. Levi is a vampire who is known for cold heartedness and merciless killings. It has been said that he lures men and women alike into his bed with him and then drains every single drop of blood from them after he is satisfied. Eren is given the task of killing Levi since he is immune to his powers. So he sets off to go undercover and vanquish this great evil from their world. But something unexpected happens, that changes everything he has known about himself, Levi, vampires and everyone and everything else in his entire world…"
"You loved him. He loved her instead. You were okay with it, but the flowers weren't. You know you were cursed, there was not other explanation of what was happening to you."

"Eren had always thought that Armin would never return to him. It'd been four years since he disappeared - why would he come back? It was pointless to hope. That is, up until Armin resurfaced. Having a random man reappear inside your home is one thing. Having him be a former lover who disappeared four years before is another. And falling back into love with him - and learning to open yourself back up to life - is a completely different story."
"From one life to another, memories bleed through the veil of time and subconscious. Sometimes we lose our minds along the way."
"Levi, a member of high society, surrounded by all the things money can buy and the people who come with it, worries only about his reputation. When the circus comes to town and his close friend Hange forces him to attend, he is frankly unamused. That is, until a carefree trapeze artist with a stupid smile and eyes that could kill catches his attention. From strangers, to friends, to something more, Levi will be faced with the impossible decision of upholding his reputation and sticking with the people who made him who he is, or standing by the ones he's come to care for and letting go of all that he used to be."
"Not all stories have happy endings, some deserve them but those are the ones that have the worst endings possible. Even if you expect a bad ending, some are just worse. Eren Jaeger didn't expect to live through the war, but he didn't think he'd die like this."
"You were pretty sure you hated your husband's new secretary. He had worked late, not returned your calls, and she said he was in a meeting when you knew he wasn't. By the time he got home you were a mess, heart running away with past pains that were not his doing or his fault. He saw your fears and wanted to help. So you asked him to make you cry. And he did."

"Ever since Levi was a teenager, he knew he'd have to marry her, otherwise he'd have to answer to his abusive uncle which never turned out well for Levi's wellbeing. But after meeting a certain singer at his favorite bar, he knew he was in deep, deep shit."
"“We’re going to die soon? Aren’t we, Ymir? Just like everyone else? We’ve ran for so long but what are we even running from any more?” Krista asks out loud one night, and Ymir’s not even sure if she’s talking to her any more by the end. “We’re running from the monsters. What else would we be running from?” ""Ourselves"""

"In the Spring of 1924, Armin Arlert moves from Michigan to New York city on behalf of his grandfather. Entranced by his new surroundings, he works as a specialised mechanic on various automotives underneath Erwin Smith. He hides his personality underneath the hoods of the cars he loves, and resolves to conceal his desires under the veneer of diligence. His quiet world is brought into startling display, however, when a chance encounter with a man from a bar leads him to challenge his life, his motives, and his very reasoning.

"Four years ago, Eren Yeager fell in love with Mikasa. Four years later, those feelings were somehow more alive than they were before. (based on a post i saw that said ""i will love you as long as the world will allow me to"" was eremika and someone said that eren would go against the world for her)"
"She has a mission to complete. Personal feelings be damned."
"Eren gets a secret admirer that sends him sketches of himself. At first, it's sweet. Then it's creepy. Then it's downright terrifying."
"Eren Jaeger has done everything right to the best of his ability. Good grades were enough for him to convince himself that all was well. As long as his only friend in the world, his mother, remained, he was capable of holding on and pushing through. She then disappeared from his life in the blink of an eye. Left to pick up the pieces, Eren begins to struggle with the same habits that cost his mother her sanity. Lonely and desperate, he grabs onto whatever and whomever he can, although he knows it will be his downfall... and it was. This is the story of a young boy's naive adolescence fading and warping into adulthood as well as the pained reality that comes along with it. Heads up, this Fic has a pretty big secret that won't be revealed until the last chapter."

You turned back to face him, your face much closer to his this time around. “Like me or think of me?” “What’s the difference?” His eyes flickered down to your lips. “Because, if you only like me,” you bit down on your bottom lip, “I would be very cruel for teasing you like this.”"
"Mikasa hates Eren. She hates that he left without a trace and she hates that he came back. She hates that he's different and she hates that she has no control over just how much she feels for him. Eren hates Mikasa. He hates her indifference to him and her new outfit and the fancy house she now lives in. He hates that she acts like they don't know each other and he hates that he still cares about what she thinks of him. They're both reaching for something that disappeared a long time ago."
"He wanted to change things, make them better for Armin, for Mikasa. But he was scared, so scared that one little change would cause their deaths. If he really wanted to change things, he would have to actually think things through. It would be the first time that had happened in a few years for Eren instead of following the script he had laid out. After a few minutes of thinking, Eren knew his plan. It would take a lot of risks, but it was better than letting Mikasa live on without him. He would require everyone and their individual skills to complete his plan. All he had left to do was to get everyone together to start it. He had no idea how to do that. He would have to take another risk, he guessed. ---------------------- What if instead of the Rumbling, Eren has another plan? (Updates On Mondays)"

"There is a beast inside each of them. When newly enslaved Annie arrived at the Jaeger khalasar, she only had one mission in mind. Escape. But as the endless long night drew near, she found herself thrown in the mess of an ancient prophecy that spoke of another Great War. Along with her in this journey was: Mikasa, the devil’s wife, Sasha, the spymaster, Pieck, the fallen princess, and Historia, the high priestess. Annie knew the path ahead wouldn’t be easy, not when she started to question her own identity, and certainly not when a mysterious blue-eyed general was always watching her. And they are hungry."
"There is supposedly only one way to obtain a new daemon and that is to meet - and touch - your soulmate. Supposedly. So of course, Eren takes the fall of a fucking lifetime, taking a daemon bird down with him.

"The nurse braced his arm and pulled out the large beam slowly, they saw Levi grit his teeth, trying to hold back any other reaction. Hanji hissed when they felt Levi grip their thigh in pain, Hanji bit their lip to keep from crying out while Levi’s hand shook in pain."
"Lillian “Lily” Carter, you’re average gymnast teacher meets an unsatisfying end to her short life by the means of an oblivious truck driver. The irony of the trope is not lost on her. Aware that all humans are reincarnated into some form of fiction or literature, she is appalled to find herself being swept away into one of the most hellish stories she could think of. She however isn't given much time to acclimate as she is found without a citizenship and promptly tossed underground in the year 841. Her story however starts in the year 846. 5 years after her untimely death and ultimate arrival here on the wonderful island of Paradis, with the help of an Innkeeper with secrets, she finds her own found family and a decent paying job as a dutiful Courier of the underground. She has quickly garnered a reputation for being skilled and efficient; however the ever present leering gaze of the greedy underground District leaders and her own itching ambition to change the story for the better may cause her unseen encounters as her actions do in-fact have consequences. After all; a second chance is still a second chance."

Her game of happiness, every day when she thought it was another blessing from God, was disrupted by the sudden divorce of her mother and father. But her meeting with Eren Yeager sparked a glimmer of hope in her life again."
"There are moments when my affection feels too big, like it couldn’t possibly all fit in my small frame, like it must exist somewhere outside of myself. Somewhere, maybe inside of Eren, maybe out across the ocean, maybe in some other universe. The idea that Eren can’t feel it, that he doesn’t feel it too, can seem inconceivable during these moments. **** Eren is a 23-year-old artist/bartender with a secret only Armin and Mikasa know: he has a 50% chance of only living until middle age. Levi is a 34-year-old tea shop owner who is oddly attracted to the kid who keeps coming into his shop with a sketchbook. Lots of pining ensues."
"Jean keeps on drowning in blue waters, and maybe a chance encounter with a stranger will have him drowning in something else instead. Or alternatively, Jean finds true love."
"Erwin isn't popular by anyone's standards. The general population, as well as much of the Survey Corps tends to think that he's unfit to lead an army, but Levi sticks by his side no matter what - he would follow Erwin Smith anywhere. Basically, I just wanted to write something really long and sappy (and fluffy and smutty) about how much Levi loves Erwin."
"The day they defeated the Colossal Titan was supposed to be a happy one. Little did they know that two soldiers would be on the brink of death; desperate for the one thing that could save their lives."

Levi bristles slightly, taking a bite of food after playing with it for the past five minutes. “Um,” Zeke says. He takes a sip of his water– cold and refreshing. “Well we met at Levi’s place of work, actually.” This piques Marie's interest. “Oh, well what is it you do?” She’s looking towards Zeke. Zeke sighs softly. “I’m a heart surgeon. I just finished up my residence about a year ago.” Her eyes widened in shock. “Oh,” she says, “a doctor. That’s amazing. And what do you do, Levi?” Zeke can tell that Levi wants to be mean with how he is biting his cheek, almost as if to stop himself – Zeke would do the same thing when he got into fights with Eren. He chews his food, swallows then clears his throat. “I’m a dancer.” He says simply, taking another bite of food. Marie looks confused, looking to Erwin for help. “So how does a heart surgeon meet a dancer? I’m sorry but that is fascinating to me.”"

"‘You don’t think this is heaven?’ ‘You and I both know that none of us are going to heaven. I’d say hell, but I always thought it would hurt more.’ Erwin sighed. ‘If you ask me, nothing hurts more than this.’ ‘What do you mean?’ ‘Getting so brief a taste of you.’ Why shouldn’t I stay?

"Just when the warrior thinks the girl will walk silently away, she turns around, dazzling him with her grey gaze. He quickly concludes that her eyes are not like stars. They are like distant galaxies in the universe that shine brightly, like sparks produced by the clash of the metal of two swords. “My name is Mikasa.” She looks up at him with the corners of her lips turned up, her cupid's bow so deep and so… captivating. “The goddess of love and beauty… or so they say.” “Eren.” He says, introducing himself, after a few seconds that taste like an eternity. “God of War.” In which the god of war falls madly in love with the goddess of love and beauty."

"Reiner woke up to the most beautiful face he’d ever seen in his life. The boy was tan, with brilliant blue-green eyes and long rich-brown hair. It was tied back in a low bun, with stray strands escaping to frame his sharp features “Are you okay?” the boy asked. Reiner opened his mouth to answer, but instead of spewing words, he threw up on the boy’s lap. Reiner, a Marleyan fighter pilot, finds himself stranded in the country he was supposed to destroy and falling for one of the devils he was supposed to hate."

"“Fine.” Levi had given in, a ghost of a smile back on his lips as he led the two of them on the dance floor. Hand in hand, pretending that there’s no one in that room, mocking the innocent and pure bond that they had, “I suppose I shouldn’t deny the King his orders.” And again, this is how it ends: With two young dancers in the middle of their gymnasium, moving along with the song with such graceful steps, not a falter in rhythm as they have been doing it for years. If you listen closely, you can hear two hearts beating in rhythm as well. This is when Erwin fell in love. By holding Levi’s hand, swaying him around, the crown shining above his head as he lets out one of those giggles again."
"""Write me letters, right now,"" she proposes. ""Write to me as if you were away."" ""That's stupid."" ""You throw that word around like it means something to me."""

"“Even you are expendable.” Erwin had said one week before a home invasion occurs while he's halfway across the country, leaving you to bear the consequences of his past actions on your own. . . . Or a story about how one man's inability to not take things for granted will come to bite him in the ass one day, in a way he least expects."
"based on the scene where hange is stitching up and bandaging levi's wounds she loves him"
"After Levi lost Erwin, he has been seeing Eren as Erwin and had been treating him like Erwin for a while, without knowing who he really was.

"You felt a light, almost reluctant touch to your skin as long fingers wrapped around your wrist—not tight enough to hurt by any means, but unexpected enough to make you falter to a pause in your stride. You turned, glancing curiously back over your shoulder to see who was preventing you from leaving the party that you’d never even wanted to attend in the first place. You couldn’t have imagined it would be him who was standing there. Not after so much time had passed. Eren."
"We’d live together in an apartment that would face the sun in the mornings, harsh light streaming in through a window that I’d always swear was placed in a terrible spot. But then I’d see him lying beside me, basking in the warmth of dawn, and suddenly the window wouldn’t seem so bad."
"Shrugging Kenny's hand off, you took cautious steps towards this kid.  Standing at a safe distance, you knelt down in front of him.  Both your eyes met.  You stared at each other, unmoving with bated breath. ""You got a name?"" You asked softly.  Still not sure whether you were looking at a living person or a dead body.  His gaze bore into you, nearly devoid of life.  It was a cold stare, one that you were certain you'd never forget. ""Levi.  Just Levi.""  He barely spoke. OR: You grew up with Levi and this is your life with him as the events of AoT unfold, with some smut sprinkled in if I feel like it."
"You’d follow him to the end of the world, you promised, only to realize how silly the words sounded with the current state of life- not to mention, you had said the same to Petra, a girl that met her fate with zombies gnawing the flesh of her thigh. The world is cruel, you decided early on. The most you could do was hope you didn't turn into one of those monsters, that someone would have mercy on your soul and kill you before it happened."
"Following the events of Ch. 127 and the dreaded campfire scene, Jean runs to seek solace in the woods after finally discovering the full truth about Marco’s death.

"“That was the moment Armin knew that him and Eren were never really quite the same, that their dreams were never mutual. Armin wanted to see the world, to experience what seemed like the impossible. Eren wanted something philosophical, an idea, a distant mirage; Freedom. Armin himself wasn’t enough, and that is what started to burn his world down.” Or A canon rewrite in which Armin is the cold and distant one, not Eren. And instead of getting played by Eren, ARMIN plays Eren and is out for fucking revenge. Essentially the Armin villain arc / corruption that we all didn’t know we wanted."

"He preferred to remain alone during his stay at Marley, it’d be easier to suppress the misery that dwelled inside his mind that way, and yet, with each passing second, loneliness and guilt seemed to begin tearing his head apart with such forbidden hostility he felt he was going to go insane.

"Levi's always been the stoic, cold-hearted captain distrustful of others and frequently annoyed by them as well. Armin's just there, trying to help the Scouts and be a good person. Will he be the one to get under the captain's skin and see if there's more to him than just being Humanity's Strongest? Will Levi be the one to see that Armin is so much more than just a quiet nerd?

"Eren Jaeger has a secret, one that is tearing him apart. Alcohol is the only thing that is holding him together, and it is breaking him in an entirely different way. When he meets Levi, he feels that he has maybe found someone who can help piece him back together. The problem is that Eren is certain Levi will abandon him as soon as he learns the source of Eren's poisonous shame. Jean Kirschtein has been a police officer for years. He's trained several recruits, but there is something different about Marco Bodt. He begins to have strange feelings toward his new partner, feelings that he is ruthlessly ashamed of. One night after a few too many drinks things get a little out of hand and Jean can't even look at Marco. He has no idea how he's supposed to continue working with him."
"Eren gets hurt while protecting Levi and he won't wake up."
"Historia looked up at the almost foot-higher girl, and she could have sworn her heartbeat increased as soon as she met her caramel eyes.  It was as time had stopped and the only focus was on her. Ymir, Marco had called her before. Ymir started walking closer, close enough for Historia to see the freckles dotted across her face and her sharp cat-like eyes that made her legs all wobbly and unsteady. Her hat was covering most of her head, but Historia could make out her brown hair that was styled in a small ponytail with a couple strands let out. It was clear to say that Historia had never felt this way before as she noticed the sound of her heart beating blurred her hearing, making it hard to hear anything. It was clear to say Historia has never felt this way before. Or When Historia, with an average (maybe a little too boring) life and a sweet personality, meets Ymir, who is a complete 180 compared to her. When the two met, their lives took a turn none of them expected to happen. But for the best, or the worst?"

"The rings adorned his coarse fingers, glistening underneath the stage light. He would throw one of it once the show was over, a gift to one lucky soul who shouted his name like a prayer. Him, standing on top of the pedestal; the magazine wanted his face to be on their covers, all tickets sold out within a few hours after the release — Eren Yeager was the guy who both men and women wanted to taste. With studio headphones on your head, vision got blurry with how many hours you spent in front of your computer, all the hard work for the last few years, you never complained. You sat on the plush office chair, ignoring the phone call from your friends to hang out because you needed to finish polishing the record as soon as possible — you were someone who missed a chance to live.

"I do use game terminology throughout, so I have listed the words I use here so you can refer back to this if needed, but I tried to keep it fairly simple (ha ha). I only touch on the dynamics of the world of Death Stranding on a surface level because the world-building is complex, and we came here to fuck Pock, not get a headache. Also, want to mention that there are allusions to the main storyline within the game, particularly regarding reader's backstory, but you do not need to be familiar with this to understand what is going on (it's more of an easter egg for those who have played)."

Please keep in mind that I am a college student, and my schedule is already crazy. Which means I may not update often, and I am just uploading this with no idea where this is going to go.

Ten years ago, Marley began a ‘large-scale military operation’ on the island of Paradis. For the people of Eldia, that meant an invasion. Special TITAN divisions swept through the country from the south, driving the defenders back to the Maria Line. When the Colossal bomb hit Zhiganshina, that line broke. Most of Eldia is under Marleyan occupation. Still fighting at the Rose Line, the decimated army has been hurriedly training more divisions, bringing younger and younger people into its ranks."

A shaky breath left Father Arlert’s lips as his eyes grazed her legs, shifting to try to soothe what she assumed was discomfort in his pants. He looked back up at her face, catching on the tears staining her cheeks. He briefly clenched his jaw, something unspeakable passing in his eyes. “God…” He muttered, and then leaned forward and licked the tears off with one quick movement. It sent a shock through her, that space between her legs throbbing with need. He stayed close after that, lips moving to mouth at her jaw, “Look at you, a sobbing mess. So pathetic. I love it.” “Please-” She choked out, as if it were the only thing she could say. Her mind was hazy, only one thing staying in focus, one person. Him. How terribly she needed him in that moment."

Their trademark black eyes, mutated vocal cords that take the appearance of gills along the sides of their necks, long limbs and bony ‘body’ make them stand out like a sore thumb. They leak strange blue blood when hurt, if hurt, and always seem to bring a putrid smell with them wherever they go. *** “Not like that.” Erwin pushed Levi down by the back of his neck so his face was against the mattress and lifted his hips into position. “Like this.” He lent into Levi’s ear. “Remember this is how I like you when I tell you to get on your knees, Levi.”"

Armin looked at her with sorrowful eyes. Mikasa took a deep breath, looking into Armin’s eyes again, “Well this is gonna hurt like a motherfucker.” That was a year ago. Mikasa had always had a thing for Eren, but she knew she wasn’t his type. Or she got the hint that he simply just wasn’t interested in her, due to the fact that she was one of his best friends, along with Armin of course. Eren had plenty of girlfriends all his life. He reached his peak in high school and that’s when he began dating like crazy. A new girlfriend almost every few months. None really lasted too long and he seemed like he was more in it for the sex. Whenever he was single though, she would try and make a move on him. Eren never caught on or reciprocated anything for her and Armin was stuck in the middle. Staying silent most of the time, telling himself that he had two of the dumbest friends."
"One hundred years ago, the people of Eldia were forced to hide. Their magic was wiped out by the world, and almost none remains. Eldians were rid of. Or, so they thought. Eren and Mikasa stumble across the kingdom in an attempt to escape the wrath of the outside world. With almost no recollection of their past lives, they are forced to make the most of what they have. When the prince of Eldia discovers them in the woods, pieces start to fit, and mysteries start to unfold."
"""Which duchy am I infiltrating?"" Levi thought the mission was going to be like any other mission he has done. He thought he'll be back to his old life after he finished it.

"Grief is like the ocean; it washes over you in a wave, often one you can see coming, and it swallows you, dragging you into the depths so you forget which way the surface lies. It leaves you choking, gagging, desperate for air, and if you relent, you sink deeper, surrounded by blue. Levi has seen grief before. He knows that ocean, has swum in it, sunk in it, drowned in it more times than he will ever want to count. And he sees another wave rising, ready to crash over him as the ocean swells at his feet. He is a boat at the mercy of all that blue, and she has never shown him mercy before. - A retelling of canon from Levi’s perspective, Levi watches Erwin make a decision that will wrench his life apart forever, leaving Levi in tatters he is not sure he can put back together in his wake."

"For Reiner Braun, there is no girl closer to his heart than his older sister of 5 years: (Y/n) Braun.  They're inseparable--like peanut butter and jelly. Their mother Karina starts pushing for (Y/n) to join the Warrior Cadets--but she doesn't want to. Feeling conflicted about her background and the war between Marley and Paradis, (Y/n) flees her home--breaking the promise she made to Reiner: that she'd never leave him alone. As Reiner joins the Warrior Cadets and gets selected to go on the mission to Paradis, he vows he'll find his sister again--no matter what.

Although, something has changed...both start developing feelings for each other...ones they shouldn't be having.

"Levi Ackerman has only one dream—to be a world renowned actor. With his looks, talent and not-so-great personality, it wouldn't be that hard to snag one role in the newest film that's searching for new faces and talents.

One day, when he goes to school, at some point, he accidentally bumps into the school's new heart throb, Levi Ackerman, who also happens to be the new guy around. And like most of Levi's fans, Eren develops a tiny little crush on the older boy. After their little bump in, Levi develops a huge crush on the timid, younger boy, feeling a need to protect him at all costs. So what happens when Levi finally finds out that people, both bullies and at home, have been hurting his sweet little Eren? He gets furious and kills them of course.

"As soon as the door closed Erwin opened his annoying mouth ""Stay away from Eren."" Levi cocked his brow. ""I mean it Levi, Eren will not be tainted by you."" ""Wow, Eren's right, you do have a parental-complex."" ""Stay away."" ""Yeah yeah whatever, can I go now?"" ""Hands to yourself, Levi"" was Erwin's last warning before he ushered Levi out the door.

"Levi never called people by their names."
"It was Erwin who had first named the stars, all those years ago on the roof of the old Survey Corps headquarters where Levi had fled to escape waking dreams of green-eyed ghosts and bloodied corpses.  Night after night Erwin mapped the heavens and named the stars. None of it made any sense to Levi, but the names of the stars kept the ghosts at bay."

"My entry for Erwin Week Day 6: Fantasy. “You brought me here.  As for what I want, that is irrelevant.  I am here for your pleasure, Master.”  The man crawled down off the bed, amazingly beautiful ass in the air and planted himself on his knees in front of Levi.  “Although, I must say, it is a treat to be in the company of a man this time.  That hasn't happened in centuries,” he purred. “M-master?  What the hell are you talking about?  What the hell are you doing?”  The man was undoing the buckle on Levi's belt. “Pleasuring you, Master.  That is why you called me."""

"Year 861. Mikasa has found peace in the aftermath of the war, and learns to appreciate the joy in her life - despite everything she has lost."
"There was probably a time in Jean Kirstein's life where this wouldn't have seemed like an inevitable outcome. Now, he cant tell you when this time would have existed because whenever he does decide to be self- reflective it always seems like it was some predestined thing. Something that was set in stone from the moment  his father's DNA crossed with his mothers. That's not to say he woke up one morning and said “I'm going to be a drug dealer.” Because it's not how it happened. But it almost is that simple."
"The life he chose for himself. For Levi."
"Levi breaks down and Eren's there to provide soundless comfort."
"“JEAN!!!! BEHIND YOU!!!!” Connie yelled but Jean didn’t have time to turn around as the seven meter-class titan picked him up. Jean’s eyes widened as he tried to struggle out. The one day he didn’t refill his blades, was the only thing on his mind. Jean closed his eyes as the titan ate him."

In order to avoid a war against the immortal, humanity has agreed to give the few remaining Type O humans to the vampiric families.

"Multicolored eyes looked up, admiring the rock hard abs, the tattooed chest, the perfect neck, and then a pair of steel blue eyes. Those gunmetal orbs were looking at him like he was a piece of meat, just waiting to be devoured. His kissable, pierced lips parted and his voice was rough and husky. ""Do you want me, Eren?"" ----------- Love? Love was a bullshit word that meant nothing. Love was something Walt Disney made up to make money. Love was a lie, Love was weakness, Love was nothing. Or....at least that's what he kept telling himself every time he looked at that damn Brat with breathtaking eyes."
"Just as World War II ends, Europe tries to repair it's self from the devastation of the Nazi's. To Levi, Englishman Erwin Smith had always been a star too far from his reach.

"Levi was on a business trip in New York City when he stumbled upon a young man in the rain."
"It doesn't happen for him like it does the rest of them. It isn't in his long winded deluded motivational speeches. It isn't in his reckless bravery or suicidal blue green eyes. It's not the way he bites his hand until it bleeds, the way he can take out 20 titans single handily in his monstrous form. It's not the hunch of his shoulders from the responsibility he carries, and it's certainly not in the way he tucks his father's key down the front of his shirt or tightens the belts around his legs. There's a lot of things it isn't, but could have been."
"Grisha Jaeger is a young man who already got to know how cruel the world can be. After the death of his little sister, the world seems like a dark and cold place, not only for him but specially for all Eldians, who are being haunted by their uncertain past.

Everyone’s dreams vary, some can see each other and even communicate with each other, and others forget things when they wake up, etc. There are many businesses and websites on finding and connecting soulmates and Eren has no leads on who his could be, so in his continued efforts to find his one true love he signs onto a soulmate search website and is matched with Jean, who pretends to be his soulmate. Things get pretty angsty in later chapters."
"Since the loss of his friends, Levi doesn’t speak to anybody. He passes his freetime alone and he doesn’t seem interested on his other comrades…except for one."
"Jean's relationship with Eren has been starting to crumble, and to make things worse, he gets a horrible feeling that Eren might just be cheating on him.

"It's been about four years since Jean Kirschtein turned his used-to-be best friend into a vampire. Not long after, Marco ran away and hasn't been heard from since. Until now. All over the country, vampires are showing up dead, drained from twin holes on their necks. Nobody knows who is causing it, and the vampire world is being thrown into a state of panic. As the murders increase, it becomes obvious that the supernatural cops aren't doing their job, and Jean has never been one to sit around while shit goes sideways. (This is the sequel to Wow, That Sucks. I highly recommend reading that before this, but I'll do my best to make this understandable as a standalone.)"
"Levi is having a nigtmare and Eren helps him deal with his emotions. (Post-Female-Titan Arc)"
"Eren lives with the second-gender system that is evident wherever you go. Alphas are expected to fight, Betas are expected to work, in rare cases fight, and Omegas are expected to... do house chores and give offspring. Eren is an Omega, and he is one of the few rare people that don't accept the system. He won’t accept an Alpha or Beta partner who only desire him because of his ability to give offspring. He hates the thought of always having to do as he's told, and not being allowed to make a change, to fight. The Survey Corps are made from strong Alphas and are who Eren has always desired to fight with in his distant dream. At an annually held fare held for his heroes however, everything changes. Eren is dragged into the inner walls, leaving his friends and family behind, and is placed to work in a Maid Café, with most of his customers being Alphas. One being the Alpha he has always looked up to, his ultimate hero, Levi from the Survey Corps. Note: Please be advised that this has VERY slow updates."

Eren is a college student just trying to get by in life with no desire to find his soulmate. But one day, after helping his friend Armin at work, he is walking home and accidentally bumps into a stranger. What he doesn't anticipate when he brushes shoulders with him, though, is a torrent of lost memories coming back to him—memories of a terrifying, cruel world that was ruled by death and memories of something that had somehow become love."
"Commander Erwin Smith and (Y/n) are madly in love with each other. He promises to keep her safe but outside the walls promises like that are hard to keep."
"There are many things in life that give us questions. There are many things in life that give us immediate answers. There are many things that will never be answered. In the eyes of a carefree, low life blonde, dwelling on such things seems almost useless and invaluable. Why press for information that will never come out? Why work so hard if the solution is right in front of you? That’s the way she sees it at least. Maybe not for her bitter rival who sees fit to dig extra deep in everything that is thrown at her. It sickens the blonde, really. The way Mikasa Ackerman is so willing to do everything to meet perfection when she’s already got the brains and brawn to demolish the world. The way she works hard to look pristine to impress everyone around her. The way she has to show off every time she does something better than the small girl. Its Extra. Annie’s anything but extra. Annie Leonhardt is a slacker and doesn’t care that she’s a slacker. Annie just doesn’t care, or so she thinks."
"The war is won, and Erwin and Levi live out deep in the woods."
"It takes a long time for Levi to fess up to the marks that he's made."
"Eren...You don't understand. I am standing here in an empty room--I have nowhere else to go. Please let me in your door, let me in your heart--I can't just keep standing here waiting for you to love me. Love me. I need to be loved.

"From the moment he saw that Titan snap his mother’s back and swallow her whole, Eren Jaeger had been determined to eliminate every last Titan – a dream that had finally become a reality… Or has it?"
"She can't go back. Not now, not ever."
"he thinks jean is adorable when he’s in denial. he can’t help but think that that blush and the unsatisfied frown and his loud yelling is pretty cute and he thinks he’s sick--lovesick--for some horse-faced asshole that he just wants to shut up by shoving a fist in his mouth, or something else."
"None"
"After Eren and Levi finally make their relationship ""official"", Eren wakes up with empty bedsheets beside him. Levi disappeared, only leaving a note, promising... ""You're my safe haven, so I'll return."" Eren slowly loses the trust and warmth they built up and goes into a state of confusion and depression. His mind continues to break down and he seeks that warmth in the numbing pain he causes himself. *Look in tags for triggers."
"“What the hell is a firework, you shitty brat?” Levi in his bed-headed glory glares at the too-peppy Eren. “They’re like...how do I explain them? Flashes of light, and lots of sound, it’s really pretty, I promise! I wish you could’ve seen what I saw in my dream. Hey, Corporal, when we obliterate all the Titans, let’s watch fireworks together!” Levi really thought that it would be possible; that was how bright Eren’s smile was. AU!"
"The more Mikasa learns about her, the less she knows. The closer she gets, the more entangled she becomes."
"Cradling Marco in his arms and lying sleepless in his bed became Jean's routine in the past months. With the painful cries still echoing in his ears, he cannot ease his mind in any other way but this."
"In which the question that's asked and answered is, what if Levi and Eren switched places (roles, ranks, ages, etc.)? Could we have a better outcome? The War against the titans is fierce, but this time around the insignia of freedom has not been completed. Lance Corporal Eren Yeager is well known as Humanity's Last Hope, due to the fact that he posseses no titan [shifting] powers but in a rage can cause them to cluster attack on a single one, a power granted to him by his father through an injection when he was at a young age. The Survey Corps regiment is still set on finding the basement. But everyone knows- Eren especially- that Hope is nothing without strength, reason being Humanity's Strongest Soldier has still not been found [Why it's not Mikasa will be explained]. Then, the Survey Corps are notified of a cadet who has the miraculous ability to shift himself into a titan; little do they know, this cadet is a rebellious brat who crosses way too many borders, ones that lead straight into Humanity's Last Hope's Heart."
"Jean and Marco have a mutual cuddle buddy relationship in order to cope with the dangers around them. --- This was honestly written for a writer's craft assignment last year, but I'm happy with how it came out. Just a little story, nothing much."
"""I, Eren Jaeger, am very certain on these few subjects when it comes to my sister's boyfriend. He's surprisingly short. He's ridiculously badass. His humor is shit. (No. Literally. He has shit jokes. And lots of them.) He's expressionless 95% of the time. He's addicted to Adam Lambert, Journey, Katy Perry, Imagine Dragons, and karaoke. I'm serious. (Never challenge him to karaoke.) He can sometimes be extremely over protective. When he smiles, it's beautiful. He's ripped. Like, six-pack-nice-arms-great-ass-mother-of-god-ripped. Yeah, he's hot. And I, Eren Jaeger, am 100% certain that I have fallen head over heels for my sister's boyfriend."""
"It might seem like a good thing, at first. Jean gets Marco back from the dead, but there's a time limit. He's only got three days before he has to let him go again. To make matters worse, Marco doesn't know."
"Since the battle of Trost,  Jean has been empty of any emotion. Trying as he might to repress everything, circumstances force him to remember all he has lost and make him realize that life won't ever be the same without Marco."
"In the late 1950s, in a small midwestern town where difference is condemned, Jean and Marco dream of a larger world and of a future where love doesn’t have to be hidden behind closed doors. A story of things lost and found, of journeys, of the magic of words and the meaning of silence."

"(Altenatively Titled: I'm Still Tied to You) Armin remembers everything from the time of the titans, the grotesque expressions of those wretched monsters to the large stone walls that caged everyone in like animals, the tragedy within those stone surroundings. Of course, he remembers the death, the mourning, that distinct smell of his comrades blood in the air. But he also remembers other memories, precious ones, one's of him falling in love with someone, marrying them, building a life with that person in that incredibly cruel  world that they'd lived in. He remembers Jean. But Jean doesn't have those memories."
"She wants to burn for him. It's the only thing that would make sense to her. Because if she can't have him and if she can't have life there is no point in doing something ever again. She imagines herself in his arms, both of them encased by flames which cannot touch them. She could accept the fire licking at her insides if it was for him."
"""That's just the way Eren is,"" Armin said, but Levi didn't buy it. No one was happy all the time. And then there was this weird feeling he got every time he saw Eren. Something was...wrong with him. After moving to Shiganshina Levi meets Eren, a 19 year old guy who never seems to stop smiling. Simply annoyed by him at first he soon notices that he isn't who he appears to be. Instead of ignoring his odd behaviour Levi decides to start investigating and finds that the mystery of Eren Jaeger is more complex than he had initially thought."

"A mission beyond the walls goes in an unexpected direction. The Scouts are forced, by poor weather, to change their plans and confront danger. Erwin is conflicted on many levels."
"—living, that is. EDIT: 9/29/19 This summary is long due for a redo- so here it is! I'm not going to go on for ages this time, just say that I'm writing an extremely non-canon fic about saving the titan trio and helping them heal. It's a mix of fluff, angst, and platonic love, and I've been told by many commenters that it's an emotional ride. Updates are slow because of life issues, I'm a tired person, etc, etc, etc. I have no intention of giving up on the fic, though, so expect it to continue whenever I have the time. To quote from my old summary; ""Canon was not nice to these kids, and I'm going to do them better."" Disclaimer: I'm not all that familiar with canon, and I don't particularly care to be. Thus, this fic is HIGHLY headcanon-based."
"My very existence bends the definition of truth. My whole life I was taught the courage of stars but never really learned. For me my brokenness was a form of art.  I have endured countless battles but yet the war extends. I could never grasp the art of living so why not thrive in the art of dying, its easier that way."
"The date is June 17, 2017. Eren Jaeger is just a normal high school student with no life. In fact, it had become kind of boring. Eren didn't do much other than go to school and play video games with his best friend Armin. Little does he know that his whole world is going to change right in front of his eyes. A couple days after summer starts, Eren sees an unusual shaped object fall from the sky. When he goes to investigate, he finds it to be a strange metallic sphere. On closer inspection, it reveals itself to be a ship, and on the inside is a beautiful creature unknown to Eren. Eren now has two choices. Will he give him to the authorities that continue to bother him at his door? Or Will he protect the strange creature from the humans who wish him harm? When everything goes down Eren will find himself strangely attached to him. This creature is so far from home, and Eren knows he will eventually wish to return. What if he can't let him go?"
"A life of bloodshed - a dirty fight for survival - seeming inevitable to the youth, a future he had been pushed into out of love; or so he had been told. That love, the promise of approval, any resemblance of worth strung him along, to follow what that man had laid out for him. It was a promise that didn't hold out, not as he hid in the back of worn wooden closet, clutching his knees as he picked up on every word of what went on downstairs. The all too sickening cracks of bone and soft pitter patter of blood filtered throughout the home, he heard the hushed whispers as they dragged his father from his home. It was easy for Eren to hide the physical quirks, to conceal a nature he feared, detested; yet to live without the structure he had previously found himself confined in proved to be the most challenging. It was uncontrollable, a nature he was unable to push down, a thing he struggled to cover. The sun would meet the moon, he'd find himself butting heads with a man he could never hope to understand, a man he couldn't burn. Or the weird, mildly dystopian supernatural-esque, and angsty au nobody asked for, but is a fucking blast to write."

"Year 860. Two years after Eren’s death, Mikasa and Jean have developed a close friendship built upon mutual support in a time of despair and loneliness, and Jean has become like a father to her son, Deron. The friendship becomes complicated after a heated moment transpires between the two of them, and Mikasa wants to make things better again."
"They have a mutual understanding. One day, Titans would be the end of them in one way or another. Drabble/One-shot"
"After failing his exams, arguing with teachers and getting in fights for what he's told was the last time, Eren finds out that he's being moved schools -- but not just to any old school. He's being forced to go to Sina Boarding School. And once the initial anger passes, the quiet bitterness sets in. He doesn't want to talk to anyone, or make any new friends, or join any club activities, or hand in his homework on time. And the fucking last thing he wants to do is talk about how he's feeling. Especially not with the annoying teaching guiding him around, the old-timey headmaster whose room smells of coffee, the irritating meatheads in his English class or his weirdly-hot-in-an-emo-way new roommate... (i.e. - the fic in which Eren and Levi end up as unlikely roommates in boarding school and shit happens.)"
"I wake up in the dark. All I hear is beeping. The darkness is pressing down on me, it feels wrong, so wrong. The beeping speeds up. I can't see. Why can't I see? Panic rises in my chest, thrashing against my ribs. The sound of my breath tearing out of me fills my ears. Someone calls my name. * When Marco feels like he has lost himself and his humanity, all he has left is Jean."
"She knew everything about Levi; what he loves, what he hates, what makes him happy, his obsession for cleaning and the type of woman he loves. His dreams. His ambition. His fear. Everything. Despite knowing all of his flaws, [F/n] remained by his side because she had fell for him. Yet, the one Levi loved was not her but, a blessed lady named Petra. [This fic is set in a Modern AU, where reader is a singer/actress, Levi; an actor and Erwin; an actor-model.]"

"Levi is a petite raven-haired high school student, unfortunately, he not only gets abused at home but at school as well, the group of jocks that bully Levi are led by none other than the school heartthrob Eren Jaeger. Levi is openly gay which one of the many reasons he gets abused, but as they graduate high school and Levi leaves his abusive family to move to a small dorm room with his ex-bully Eren, the tall brunette has matured over the long summer and somehow not remembering the raven, he then gets flashbacks to his high school self-bullying the shorter male and instantly regrets and tries to smooth things over. Will Levi forgive Eren for the years of torture and embrace his feelings or will he forever push him away?"
"Levi finds another way to honor the dead, and after Jean joins in with him one afternoon, it becomes a tradition."
"Fifteen years after humanity seems to have won the war against the titans, Armin takes a walk and finds it's not nearly as peaceful as he would like it to be because every little thing reminds him of his friends."
"""Ne, Levi, we used to be like that."" Hanji lets out a light laugh, clearly trying to lighten the mood as she brings her mug to her lips, eyes shining with a certain glint behind her glasses. Levi makes a quiet noise of agreement in the back of his throat as he watches the pair dance around each other. He doesn't look away from the window, doesn't look away from the couple, doesn't look away from Eren. Even though he agreed, he didn't believe so. He and Hanji were never like that, not at all. Eren and Jean were two completely different people with a completely different relationship. They bickered playfully, threw around simple insults that meant nothing to the other because they knew how they felt. He and Hanji were polar opposites, one of them a crazed, overly optimistic maniac and the other a rude, stoic and stone cold soldier.  Hanji and him had never been very affectionate towards each other in their relationship. Levi kept it hidden, pushing Hanji away even though they were a couple. They were nothing like Eren and Jean. They'd never been through young love like that."
"They were hungry. They were starving. They had to survive another year until they could sign up for the Training Corps. “What do you want?” “Oh, a little of this. Little of that. Depends on you how much food ya want. More you give, more ya get. Get it? Simple.” Simple. Eren didn't need to tell Mikasa or Armin how he returned with so much food. Simple. Nobody else needed to know what went on in the darker alleyways of that town. Simple, right? Until he sees some familiar faces passing him in the halls of the Survey Corps. Until Captain Levi senses something not quite right with Eren Jaeger. Until simple becomes more complicated than ever before."
"I grimace as I wipe the blood off my knife with the underside of my boot. ""Fucking bullshit-"" I mutter under my breath as I turn to leave the shop, but a quiet sound stops me in my tracks, a weak sob coming out from behind the counter. I take my gun out and slowly make my way around the aisles to the back of the room. I’m quiet, careful not to startle who, or whatever, is hidden away. Then I cringe, stepping on a discarded CD case, looking down to see Phil Collins' face split into a hundred little pieces. Bollocks. What kind of bullshit rookie move was that, Levi? The quiet sobs stop sharply and I decide to just rip off the proverbial band aid, stepping swiftly around the counter and pointing my gun at…a kid? What the hell? Mikasa and her younger brother, Eren, are saved by a small group of survivors from becoming another addition to the walking dead. The two are taken back to a growing refugee camp outside the city's limits and need to learn to become part of a new community. Eren, taking no time at all to win the people over with his beaming smile, leaves Mikasa struggling to connect with anybody, and feeling alone in this new gruelling world she finds company in the most unlikely of individuals."

"future fic where armin is blinded and jean becomes commander - originally posted here --------- Most tragedies come and go in the blink of an eye - the things that affect us most are the ones you pay the least attention to at the time. Jean wouldn’t even say that dying is something to be feared anymore, only pain. Death becomes a sigh in the wind, a force of nature. It’s living that was always the most difficult thing to do."

"It's been some time since their funeral, but as spring rolls around Levi is drawn back to their eternal resting places. Hidden in the overgrown part of the cemetary, time stretches into eternity, and it's a bit too cold to sit outside for so long but he doesn't really care, it's comforting here and he's alone, so why should he move...?"
"Inspired by my favorite Night Vale Radio tweet. Levi's thoughts."
"“But maybe it's okay.” Jean says surprisingly calm “Maybe he wasnt meant to be mine. He doesnt seem like someone whom can belong to someone right?  Maybe it was enough to just know him like I have, to know I exsist in the same time that he does y'know? Maybe that just has to be enough.” “You don't mean that.” She says blunt in her kindness. “No.” Jean admits closing his eyes. “But I think maybe one day I can.” // Or, where Jean Kirschtein is no stranger to loss. ...And neither is Eren."

"SPOILERS FOR AOT LATE SEASON 1/MANGA CHAPTERS 19 ONWARDS (FEMALE TITAN ARC) Armin is briefly assigned to guard Annie's cell whilst the Scouts aren't actively travelling outside the walls. His next and final encounter with her changes the way he sees her forever."
"Annie has been freed from her crystal and now must pay the price for her actions. Seeking to keep the power of the Female Titan out of the hands of her enemies, Mikasa must take the power for herself. She has no doubt in her mind that she can do it, but what will she do when Annie has one final request?"
"Out of nowhere, Annie dumped Mikasa and moved away the summer before senior year. No one could get in touch with her, and the two girls spent the next four years missing each other. When they do see each other again, Mikasa only has one question: Why? -- Inspired by Panic! at the Disco's Lying Is The Most Fun A Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off and Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met)."
"A car was waiting for her at the entrance of the building, and she stared at it for a moment before she observed her surroundings. People walked over the streets, going to unknown places, just like her. The traffic noise was annoying and as alive as the people creating it, and some pigeons were flying in the blue sky, making the combination odd through her eyes. Mikasa didn’t understand why, but when she closed her eyes, she could feel her life was always a lie. “Ms. Ackerman?” Said her driver, coming to take her to the car. She felt in pieces. Still, she smiled like always."
"In the wake of tragedy, Porco moves into the Liberio Apartments to start anew. He's able to lay low for a while, avoiding his friends and family to focus solely on picking up the pieces of his life. Until he meets his eccentric neighbor, Pieck... If there's one thing he learns from their relationship, it's that life is chock-full of the unexpected."
"The union of a fallen angel and a human was taboo of the worst kind. And so from the moment of Eren’s birth, Heaven and Hell’s creatures had set their sights on him. Because sleeping within him is the power of the Nephilim, evil giants who in the past, threw the world into chaos. If this power is allowed to awaken, Eren will have the ability to unite and command others of his kind, wreaking havoc not only against earth and humanity, but also against Heaven. And Hell would like nothing more than to join the fight against God and his angelic creatures. Enter Armin Arlert. One of Heaven’s loyal soldiers who has been tasked to keep watch over Eren, with explicit orders to strike the youth down if at the first sign of that evil power manifesting itself. Will Armin be able to keep his God given mission, and prevent the realms from falling into catastrophe? Or will his feelings get in the way, thereby allowing the Nephilim to tip the balance between Heaven and Hell?"
"I was listening to Christina Perri's A Thousand Years (which I have recently discovered was from Twilight, lol, I never realized) and I just felt that this could work with Eren and Levi. Or just anyone and Eren, really. But I'm a fan. So, it was Levi. <3 Anyway... on to the summary: Eren saw it all. The death of the last titan and the destruction of the wall, the freedom of humanity. He also saw the death of humanity's strongest and the discrimination against the remaining titan-shifters. One thousand years finds him with no more will to live, but no desire to die. And then he meets Levi Asselin... and he's so similar to the Levi that he watched die before he could tell him all the things he needed to."

"Three months ago, Eren was in a life altering car accident. Out of the precinct for three months left him a bit out of touch with the detective scene, and the new undead additions to his line of sight have left him a little out of touch with life. He could have lost an arm, left paralysed from the waist down or reduced to a vegetable in the hospital, but no...he can just see Casper in his fucking kitchen. After a few weeks to adjust to his new 'sight' Eren starts to think he won't be able to handle this - the death, the sorrow, the loss. He doesn't think he can cope with it alone. That is, until he meets one ghost, a short, grumpy ghost with the kind of detective mind Eren would kill for, and a hankering for some cigarettes. Apparently the dead can't smoke though, so, huh, who knew?"
"Erwin Smith, boss of Titan Taxi's picks up an enigmatic, and rather moody passenger - Levi Ackerman. He's quickly smitten - but Levi is newly single, confused, and not exactly ready to enter a new relationship. Cue angst. Levi uses Erwin for causal sex, and teases him whenever the opportunity arises, but Erwin needs more. Erwin proceeds to be driven to distraction by Levi's verocious sexual appetite, and then he finally snaps, and exerts his dominance over Levi. Erwin is left broken, feeling utterly shameful.  Levi is left confused, and looks in all the wrong places for the resolution he so sorely needs. The spark of attraction between the two men doesn't ever look like it'll be rekindled, until good friends start to intervene."
"Eren accidentally comes out to his father, who isn't at all pleased to learn of his son's sexuality. Violence ensues, and Eren calls upon the only person he can. His boyfriend."

"Hey Sasha, You know, sometimes I forget that we’ve only known each other for a few years.  It seems like you’ve always been there, and I can barely remember what my life was like before you were in it. I’m not really sure why I’m writing you a letter, instead of just talking to you, but I dunno.  I’m scared of being forgotten.  So I’m going to write the story of my life, but the story of my life isn’t really complete unless it’s the story of our life. - In which Connie tries to mourn and loves Sasha with all his heart."

"High school AU where the soldiers are students at a high school called Sina High. Follows the love lives of multiple students, and even a few teachers."
"One more step. Erwin focused all his failing will on putting one frozen foot in front of the other.

"A thousand years ago, a single person developed an ability to wield magical powers. Now, roughly 10% of the country's population is made up of mages. However, only nine of the ten types are allowed to live. Most see that as justice, but not aspiring mage Eren Jaeger - not when it's his own life on the line.

"I remember her coffin, a pure white one, like the snow we had to trudge through, I was in a dress and it was cold. I remember my uncontrollable tears. I don't remember if I was even able to say goodbye or 'Gute Nacht'.

I remember finding every single drawing we'd ever created and given her. She kept them all."

Starting with a one-night stand, it was supposed to be simple and detached, but things never stay the way they wanted. Leading a double life is hard, especially when you're trying to fool yourself.

"None"
"I loved you, I love you and I will always love you. As far as my heart knows, you were the only one. The one who gave me harmony in an unstable world.

A world that has trapped you in the bindings of complete loneliness. A world that has convinced you that you must wage war with tooth and claw not as a soldier, but as a warrior. Orphaned and transformed at a young age, you know exactly how hellish the world can be. You tell yourself no one knows how awful fate can be, whether it be a person of your kind, or an outsider of your land. But, is it really true?

"I always thought that love would be constantly happy.  That someone would write me love songs and stupid poems and everything they did would make my heart flutter.  I thought that there was always one person you could depend on no matter what to be there for you.  Someone who still cared for you despite all your flaws.  Someone who could see the best and the worst of you and still think you were the greatest person in the entire world. If that was love, then something in my life must've gone horribly wrong."

"It was previously unheard of for anyone to join the trainee ranks a mere thirteen months before graduation. As shocking, unfair and impractical as it sounds, it's happened. Three years into their training, the 104th Cadet Corps has a new face— a girl who was taken in under ""special circumstances"" and has since barely shown herself among the other trainees.

"The summer they lived above Lord’s 24 Hour Laundry and Dry Cleaning was one of the worst of Erwin’s life.

"Hanji Zoë. I always was the one who nobody wanted to spend time with, unless it was to hurt me physically or mentally. I got hurt in ways I never expected to get hurt, people who I never thought would betray me, did so. My trust in others shattered like thousands pieces of glass and building it up again was practically impossible. They broke me, hurt me, beat me and laughed about it. None of them showed any signs of regret and they kept going further. They got bigger while I shrunk smaller and smaller. I had nothing to hold onto, nothing that gave me strength, I was on the ground until I got picked up and got taken care of by the only one who would’ve ever taken time to fix me, and I slowly started to believe that everything would work out eventually. I had to believe it, even if I knew it wasn’t going to work the way I imagined it would. There was a danger behind every corner, a trap behind every promise, bad behind every good intention, and bogus behind every smile. I couldn’t take it, but I was thankful I wasn’t entirely alone at least."

Will their life change? I wrote this as a short story for @leviinwinterfell on Instagram. Enjoy reading."
"“Where are you, Erwin?” His voice was gentle, as gentle as Levi’s voice had ever been, as it was capable of being. Erwin blinked, his eyes studying Levi’s face, that handsome, boyish face that he had fallen in love with, that he had dreamed of, longed for. There was a look of concern etched on those dark features, haunting those steel gray eyes. Levi shook his head, stood on his toes, to reach up and place a hand on Erwin’s cheek. “Where do you go?” With every step they took towards the truth, towards avenging his father’s death, Erwin began to feel himself pulled further and further away from those he loved. Mike, Hange, Nanaba, Levi above all. And he was sure no one saw the change in him more than Levi. But his search for the truth had consumed him, eaten him alive. He was a slave to that desire, to that dream. It kept him alive in a way nothing else could. Not even Levi."

More specifically, his life revolved around his favorite character in that show. When a chance arises to meet the character and his actor too, Eren is pulled into a stunt that flips his life upside down. A stunt that allows Eren to spend way more time with a short, grumpy actor than he ever could've dreamed of. Or basically Levi's an actor. Eren's a fanboy. A chance of a lifetime creates a way for all of Eren's little fanboy dreams to come true."

"The Sun is sinking slowly, the sky painted in different shades of pink and orange... It's beautiful and Eren's chest feels fuller, his heart lighter as he drifts. It wouldn't be all so bad, Eren thinks. If the ocean took him away, never to return. He imagines his lungs filling with the water, breathing the ocean as he does air. It'd probably burn but Eren yearns to be a part of the sea - to forget his troubles, to be unaffected by his past traumas, his mental illnesses. It wouldn't be terrible, not in the slightest."
"Hange's voice is rough when she speaks, throat sore from choking on sobs and mind hazy from the endless torture she’d witnessed today. “I love you, Levi,” she whispers, voice ever so soft and fatigued. She never realised how much shouting could damage somebody’s vocal cords, since she’d never done much of it in the past, after all."
"Here is a compendium of short stories, one shots and drabbles that i'm throwing together.  You're going to see: Reiner, Mike, Bertolt, Erwin and perhaps more.  More warnings and tags in each of the chapters.  There is noncon, however it will always be noted at the start."

"Waking up from Nightmares drenched in sweat and with tears in his eyes, was something Levi had to deal with almost his whole life. Dreams which are filled with memories of another time, another life. He knew from the first night it happened that he couldn't be the only one to have those dreams and he slowly realized that he was right. There were others having dreams about the same fucked up world he had lived in in his past life. But quickly he realized that not everyone he knew from his past was able to remember those times. His whole world breaks apart when he realizes the person who meant so much to him although he had never met him himself has no memories of his tragic past."

"When Eren left, Levi could feel the joy in his heart vanish. His own tears were quick to well up in his own eyes, a mixture of frustration and depression would fill his heart. He didn’t know how to fix Eren, he simply couldn’t fix Eren."

"The sound of the waves crashing against the shore shook him out of his trance. Eren sighed as he repositioned himself on the sand. If this had been another time and place then maybe he would've had the luxury of enjoying the calming murmur; this slow, tranquil background noise.

Eren lives a similar life, happy and full of freedom, but lacking someone to ground him. Their families, bitter rivals, remained as such for decades... Until the events of one summer. Or... the Romeo and Juliet AU nobody asked for! This just hit me when I was listening to Check Yes, Juliet by We The Kings, but it is NOT a songfic. This story is a modern (very loose) adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, starring Eren and Levi. *****IF YOU DISLIKE OR ARE OFFENDED BY THE EREN X LEVI SHIP FROM ATTACK ON TITAN, PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS WORK. There’s no explicit content and I will be adapting ages in this AU, but the canon basis still stands.*****"
"No matter how rambunctious, hot headed, and unruly he was, Eren Jaeger was still a doctor's son. And a doctor can save you...or take you apart. (Where we get to see the smarter side of Eren that's always been overshadowed by his anger, and how that changes everything .)"
"Humanity survived and the Titans have been wiped out. All that remains is to help repopulate. The Military has issued out a series of surveys to all factions of which each member must complete in order to ensure maximum compatibility. That is not to say the results will be agreeable, however. (Levimika, Eruhan--Multiple Ships) Rated M for some language and sexual themes. (COMPLETE)"
"A companion to canon. Over the years, what starts out as mutual respect and admiration grows into something far deeper than Eren and Levi imagined it would."
"""I love you. I don't want you to say anything back and I expect that you push me away after this and treat me cold, but I do love you and that won't change. I don't want to be gone without telling you."" This story takes place in episode 3 and up to episode 5 of season 3"
"It couldn't fucking end this way. Not when we finally found happiness in this godforsaken rock. Not when we finally won."
"Eren must learn the harsh realities that go along with being Humanities Last Hope but this lesson comes at a high price."
"It all started with one tall freckled stranger, one oblivious blond and one crushing best friend, is this love triangle destined to be, or is it all just unrequited love? It all started at a beach party.. little did they know it would end up like this. 3 Simple rules, what was so difficult about that?"
"Levi Ackerman has been one of the world's most skilled assassins as long as he can remember. He's also always been alone, and liked it that way. That is, until his boss forced a partner on Levi. Not just any partner, a hot-headed, loud mouthed boy who only cares about himself. Levi is stuck in a vicious cycle of starting his new life with the younger boy, not only learning to work together. But both have to work as a team. And bonding in ways they didn't think was possible."
"Somehow Eren is still the most beautiful, awful thing Levi has ever seen. (Podfic for Unlocked by thisgirlsays22)"
"Levi is determined to fulfill his promise to Erwin."
"Hannes grabbed Mikasa, thinking Eren would follow. Only he didn’t. He was standing at the titan’s feet when it grabbed his mother and ate her. That was the last anyone saw of him. Cut to 5 years later, when the colossal titan appears again at Trost, and and everyone is freaking out. Suddenly, this titan appears and starts killing the others. Turns out to be Eren, who has been living for 5 years alone in titan territory."
"Eren was the second son. He was supposed to be free to love and marry whoever he wanted. So why was he being sent to marry some stranger?"
"Written for Eruri week 2018 day 3: Enemies to Lovers. Levi has noticed it for years but doesn’t say anything about it."

"Eren joins the military and begs to become Captain Levi's assistant, hopefully speeding up the process to joining the Survey Corps, a childhood dream of his. War is a struggle, especially when you’re in love. It gives you a new reason to live and fight. Eren is in quite a predicament when he falls for the older soldier."
"Details how Bertolt Hoover and Annie Leonhardt's personality changes through the years, the circumstances behind it, and ultimately how it results to the development of their relationship."

She almost wanted to force her into her old clothing, just like she used to do for her before she gained her confidence, along with her Erwin. She always helped her out in her time of need, when she felt hurt and insecure, it was time for her to do the same."
"You're a simple android destined for a simple existence. Sitting under the lonely starlight, you dream of faraway galaxies and grand adventures.

"Enemy, apprentice, friend. Associate is too clinical, lover sounds too personal, partner too enduring. Confidante? Comrade? Companion? There is no word for what Levi is, to him. What do you call an equal other than an equal? A counterpart, Erwin thinks. - from ACWNR to fall of Wall Maria"
"I won't use any description for my oc so you can imagine her to look like you if you want😌 -- Four kids living together in the underground, committing crime to survive. One day, three of them are offered a chance to be forgiven in exchange for their strength. During their first mission, Isabel and Farlan die, leaving Levi with a choice. Save his last standing friend from the underground to possibly get eaten by a Titan, or leave her to rot and get eaten by the underground city's darkness.

"Everyone is saddened by the loss of Erwin Smith after taking back Wall Maria, but nobody is as sad as Levi and Hange. One night, they find comfort in each other."
"When Hange met Levi, little did she know everything that would come after. Not just titans and the end of the world, but their own personalities, problems, and not to mention those developing feelings none of them want to acknowledge. Over time their relationship changes, for good and worse. But at the end they always come back to each other. It’s only a matter of time. —AKA the LeviHan journey. From meeting to friends, to something more, to hating each other (or do they?), to rekindling their relationship, etc."
"Eren Fluff, mostly platonic situations with the other characters. Eren being cute with his friends and officers. I also do chapters with the other boys as the focus :) TW*"
"""To understand my feelings for Levi it would be necessary to understand the meaning of life itself, I wished I had never met him because his non-existence hurt me less than knowing that in my memories he was real, but in my stretched hands he was not, I wished that the sponges I rubbed on his skin or my shy kisses on his cheek would be enough to erase the calendars in the corridor, to erase the territorial marks of what ate him claiming him his, and I found myself powerless knowing that he was fading i couldn't stop him.That I never had the power to free him from the chains of those who made us human, because his flowery hands, his ignorant kindness and his warmth were alien to human cruelty."""
"Isn't it funny, how at one moment, life is sparkling and bright like the sun in a blue sky, and then the next it all starts fraying at the seams? And then you look up and the dark sky, you stare at the stars and you ask them, how did this happen? How did everything break in an instant?"
"""Armin knew Jean wouldn’t fully belong to him the same way he knew he would never fully belong to Jean. Armin knew he’d been in love with someone else too long to move on completely."" Jean and Armin are in a relationship, but both know in their hearts they'll never love each other as much as they want to."
"The arms of war which hold me dear, have comforted me and strained me since birth. Born into a life dedicated to unjustified killing directed at the devils that live across the open sea. But when you suddenly invade my land, my Oh Holy land, with your damned morals and blood, I shiver at the way your eyes glaze over me. Now I must be damned, for what matters more to me? The values of war that have held me dear, or your arms that are held open in waiting."
"After the war has ended, the loss of brother in the warzone kept haunting Porco's soul. He felt devastated and the only thing he was excited for was seeing Pieck, his fiance, waiting for him in the train station. Little did he know she'll bring him a surprise..."

"The most important lesson you learned from the Survey Corps was that regret was the root of all lost causes. Life had no in-betweens; it was either you were, or you weren't alive. On the field, it was the same: you did it or you didn't. And you would have to answer for that choice, so the only thing you could do was to make the decision you regretted least. Commander Erwin believed this, so Captain Levi surely did. And now, so did Jean. Or, The aftermath of the Return to Shiganshina, where Jean reflects on the lessons he's learnt under the late commander's tutelage."
"Mikasa talks to Sasha about her feelings; but the girl is not there to listen. Song: Lucy — Skillet"
"Mikasa and Eren hit a rough patch, Mikasa seeks comfort in Armin, the comfort becomes more."
"and it's just around the corner, darlin cause it lives in me no, i could never give you peace winter 844"
"Your best friend Eren despises the idea of soulmates and wishes to live a happy life with his girlfriend, who does not match the mark on his neck, paying no mind to the limitations of the universe. After finding out that you have always been his soulmate, you hide the truth from him because you prioritize his happiness. You suppress your romantic feelings as much as possible, all until Eren decides to cut the only hope you had of you getting together one day. And this is when it all starts to collapse."
"Marco breaks up with Jean."
"As unpleasant as being shot was, Sasha isn’t all too surprised to find that her eyes slowly flutter open some undetermined time later. There’s still the telltale ache of injury radiating from her navel to her pelvis, back, and chest, but it’s nothing a seasoned soldier like herself can’t handle. Her flesh feels solid, her clothes real. She can pinpoint the exact place where the cotton slides around her shoulders and caresses her skin, the collar far too big, but that too has weight on her body. Weight that feels tangible and completely, undoubtedly real. Her shaking fingers press deeply into the junction between the skin of her jaw and her neck. She waits, counting the seconds, to find her heartbeat. She waits, and waits, and waits. There is no pulse."
"Working towards a degree to become a Veterinarian, your professor, Keith Shadis, decided to give his students the option to do 'Secret Santa' for extra credit. Taking the opportunity to receive a better grade, you end up with Levi Ackerman. He's a stranger to you, so you try to find ways to know more about him... but is it for Secret Santa?"
"“Hey, Levi?” Erwin said and rapped on the door. “Yeah?” Asked Levi over the sound of the shower. “You know that pan you made the pizza in last night?” “Yeah, what about it?” “Well, I noticed you didn’t wash it with the other dishes last night, which is fine, you do a lot of work, but I tried to wash it this morning and I can’t get that black stuff off. I scrubbed it with soap and hot water for like a half hour and it won’t get clean.” There was a pause for a moment and all Erwin could hear was the shower running. Then Levi spoke. “…You used soap on my cast iron skillet?”"
"Levi is the Corps' omega; it is his duty to warm the beds of soldiers, at the pleasure of the Commander, Erwin Smith. Wall Maria has fallen. Erwin leads a force into titan-territory to help find survivors, grain, and gold; his life is increasingly without pleasure, save for the omega Levi who keeps him company on dark nights. Meanwhile, in the walls, the Interior voices concern over the loss of it's omega population, and the nobility seeks to ensure omegas remain in their control."
"Captain Levi wishes to spend the last day before the 57th Expedition Outside the Walls in good company — with no other than that recruit from the 104th who he struggles to keep out of his head. *Female reader insert, but for the sake of this fanfic, we’ll call you Satoru ^^ *Part 2 of a series, but it can be read on its own (there’s a few references to Part 1, but that’s it). *NO SPOILER"

"""What the hell do you think you're doing!"" Levi said, disappointment and annoyance clear in his tone. He stood in the open door way, eyebrows furrowed as he took in the scene before him.

"“I don’t want to talk to you,” Levi muttered, “I’d rather be killing you.” Zeke was silent for a moment, rolling his eyes and palming his shirt pocket. He pulled a cigarette pack out and plucked one out, lighting it with a pack of matches Levi had procured for him. It was the only nice thing he’d done for Zeke, other than not killing him right on the spot. But the man smoked like a chimney, and Levi hated the smell. “You know killing me won’t bring him back right?” Zeke said as he puffed on the cigarette, letting the smoke rise into the air."

"The day Arimin first laid eyes upon you, he admired you. He fell straight into adoration for your elegance. The grace of an angel, the face of a goddess. He was only a scrawny kid then, a kid who didn’t fully understand the fervor, love or attraction he was feeling toward you. He didn’t understand beauty--however, he knew in that moment he gawked at you in the middle of the dusty streets, that you were the embodiment of it. Your charm didn’t help him. Your smile only daunted his heart, and your attention was delectable. Soon after catching eyes with you, he built a friendship with the angel on earth; a childish friendship. He should have cherished, protected, and prioritized it. Though, you agonizingly thanked him."

"It’s not easy being five years old, Levi Ackerman thinks. He has to do homework every night, his bedtime is far too early, and worst of all: he’s being forced to be a boy scout. Convinced things can’t get much worse, Levi is proven wrong when his mother falls ill, which forces him to move in with his scary uncle Kenny and his weird roommate. Struggling to fit into an already big, confusing world, Levi meets a boy who makes everything just a little bit better."
"Who could have guessed, that a single piece of paper could change a decision Jean thought was set in stone? Or Clearing Marco's bunk, Jean finds a letter he didn't know existed."
"a collection of one-shots that take place in the ""i (almost) do"" timeline"
"ON TEMPORARY HIATUS. Sequel to Memoirs of the Lost Loser, which is undergoing heavy editing for the Watty's. Read at your own risk. *** Following her exile back from her world, Reader once again, indulges a stupid decision to hop back on the  platform of blue lights and jump to the world she considers home. But this time, not to save an estranged humanity, but go through it, to save the people she loves. But how much is she willing to pay this time? Or maybe, realizing the cost as she goes on, will she be willing to pay the price at all?"
"crack ships and literally a lot of porn"
"When they were nine years old, Eren made Mikasa marry him. Maybe he knew even then that it would be the only wedding they would ever have."
"Levi is diagnosed with a rare genetic disease. Hange, his respiratory therapist, is determined to brighten his outlook on life."
"only a couple days have passed since the battle of Trost, and Jean is hit the hardest. What will Sasha and Connie do to comfort him?"
"You see, it is true to find your one and only with a single touch but it doesn't work until you wake up one day and end up with a tattoo on your wrist with the amout of people you are allowed to touch to get their memories of each other. That was one downfall, the second? You don't get it so it's like you're watching a movie together and see both sides. You only see your side, so if you were deeply in love with that person and they hated you. You wouldn't know they hated you unless they told you. And you learn what they knew of that person and how they interacted."
"It had to be done, he’d assured himself, over and over. He had to protect Erwin at any cost, even if that meant from Erwin himself. Even if it meant Levi would never see him again — as long as he was alive, it didn’t matter. Levi breaks Erwin’s leg at the last minute to keep him from riding to Shiganshina."
"Supernova a star that suddenly increases greatly in brightness because of a catastrophic explosion that ejects most of its mass. Five astronauts, five friends get stuck in the deadly trap in outer space."
"It’s been months since Levi last saw another person. Well, another human who was still entirely human. But out on an errand, travelling the forest and edging dangerously toward town, Levi runs into a young man. A living, breathing, perfectly normal person. After an unfortunate struggle with an Infected, he reluctantly brings the intimidating man back to his hideout. He owes him after all. The problem is Levi doesn’t like to owe people, not even if it means eating for the first time in days. Because he doesn’t trust this stranger an inch."
"There they were, one step away from the edge of the building. Rain gushed down Tokyo as Levi held her hand. ""Let me go, will you?"" or, a Racing Into the Night AU with MC!Levi"
"Burdanded with the knowledge of what she is, Ymir doesn't feel she deserves y/n."
"Pieck comforts you after a night terror"
"It’s the early hours of Christmas morning, and Annie awaits Armin’s return after four months of filming all the way across the country. She’s been unable to reach him, and it’s long past since when he was supposed to come home. [Gift for @chrnop on Twitter]"
"you and Eren have known each other since you were little, but you never really got along and he would always let you know just how much he despised you. What if you were both just good at hiding?"
"You were both using each other, running away from unreciprocated feelings: escapism at its finest. But the more it went on, the less you tried to escape. Had you just trapped yourself for a second time?"
"Eren Jaeger. That was the name of the man who had killed your boyfriend, and the name of the person whose life you should have ended to get revenge, but life itself, as well as emotions, is not something you can control, and stories don't have only one side to them. Disclaimer: this fic doesn’t glamorize any of the mentioned issues in the tags, it’s entirely against them."
"Jean meets his eyes again, something burning in them that makes Armin want to turn to the water and never look back. But he holds his gaze, like it's a challenge."
"Basically twilight except everyone's gay and there's no vampires (Every one is 18 or older, its taken during the times of s4)"
"Part 2 of Fear After a certain event occurred at the Medical Bay, it's finally time to departure from everything and lead a peaceful life"
"Levi pointed to himself, crossed his arms in an X shape over his chest with closed fists, then pointed to me. ""I love you."" My eyes shot wide open as I looked at him in shock and disbelief. All I could do was stand there with my feet glued to the floor as he repeated the gesture and then signed my name the way I taught him to under the lamplight that one blissful night. ""I love you, Artemisia."" _____ Artemisia Leos was born mute, so her life as a silent soldier in the Survey Corps was not an easy one. She and Levi Ackerman find their fates entwining as they escort Eren Jaeger to a secluded castle so Hange Zoe can experiment on him. However, Eren has urges he can't restrain and his actions leave Artemisia with irreversible trauma. Will Levi's healing hands and gentle words really help her overcome her trauma, or will they own sow more distrust within her? Without Artemisia's ability to speak, new challenges are presented to her and Levi. Their relationship will either sink or thrive. _____ Claimer: Artemisia Leos, Lina Schnider, and Celia Bortnik are all original characters that I created Disclaimer: I don't own any of the Shingeki No Kyojin characters"
"A Y/N(reader) perspective of the timeline of Attack on Titan. As a medically trained soldier, can you really be of use to the survey corps? Can you manage the love you feel for the commander..or the buried love still inside of you for his right hand? Together you work to save humanity."
"Betrayals, Painful trials, and Disappointments. In the end, exhaustion takes over... and you can't even think. The only thing you can do is move forward. //Armin's POV // Drabble //"
"STATUS : INDEFINITE HIATUS Eren can't wrap his mind around the fact that you're his , the blond sweet nothing he grew up with, the gentle competition he never took seriously, exclusively Armin's . He was never one to crave a relationship, swapping out girls like an unfulfilling losing hand of cards, the full deck appearing dull and boring in his eyes. But then, there's you . Maybe he would mind his own business if he actually felt that Armin deserved you, and maybe he wouldn't see your face whenever his eyes shut if you hadn't engraved it so deeply into his mind. It's unfair and instantaneous. He never even asked to fall for you, and yet he can't seem to see an end as he drifts. For once, Eren has set his eyes on something he actually craves, and he won’t rest until he can call it his own. He’s practically obsessed, and all it took was that first glance; all it took was the moment. series spotify playlist :)"
"Life up to this point had been shitty.As you resign yourself to student debt, you suddenly get a notification from Erwin Smith, head soccer coach at EUP, a private but elite college. Pleading his case to you, he lost his star goalkeeper, and offers a deal too good to be true. Accepting the scholarship, you head to the Eldian University of Paradis and start a new and scary journey, one where you learn to trust, open up, and truly be yourself again When you get to school, many are skeptical of the circumstances of your arrival, the scholarship, and your abilities-- but the team isn't one to question head coach Erwin's judgement. So it's up to you to earn their trust and respect. Alongside navigating your new team dynamic, you find yourself perplexed by a stoic-faced bad boy, Porco Galliard. He seems like a hard-ass, but he's more of a soft hard-ass, and you can tell there's more to him that meets the eye. He's hurting, like you, but will his pride and ego keep you two from being more than just rivals? Or will you be the one weakness he never knew he had?"
"One autumn day, Erwin calls for a mandatory leave, and Levi learns the heartbreaking reason why he does so, on the specific date of the 14th of October. Or, As Erwin is adjusting to the life of a commander, he and Levi talk about remembering their families, and learn how to trust one another over their mutual losses."
"You really just wanted to get your friends the help they needed. Being hunted down and arrested by the survey corps was supposed to go smoothly, a quick in and out type of mission. You were only supposed to deal with the grating Captain Levi for a few weeks at most, unfortunately, things don't always go to plan. Reader is a well-trained, rather wealthy assassin. Levi is, well he's Levi. Erwin is a scheming little rat, but we still love him."
"Levi is the most notorious thug in the Underground City, leading his small gang comprised of his two best friends and his lover and ruling the city with an iron fist. The one thing that they all want more than anything is to escape the city and live above ground, but it turns out that it's easier said than done. When the group gets into trouble, burned on a job that they completed and never got paid for, they have to try to find out who's trying to sabotage them, and what those people really want. Underground City AU where Petra grew up in the underground the same as Levi."
"As punishment for almost burning down one of the biology labs, college senior Hange Zoë has to tutor any students needing help in Dr. Shadis's biology class--unfortunately including Levi Ackerman, the bitchiest English major they've ever met."
"Based on an rp I once had. Levi comforts Eren from his nightmares. (Btw have you noticed I suck at summaries?)"
"Everything started out just fine, why did it have to all come to this? Why did he have to lose everything he had all over again, he had just started college, he had expanded his group of friends and nothing will ever be the same after this. This is a 80's timeline based story of the AOT cast in a zombie apocalypse setting."
"Humanity begins to expand it's territory outside the walls, but as they draw near the ocean, tragedy strikes."
"Eren and Armin are oblivious to each others feelings so their friends suffer as they watch the two ignore their feelings. Or Eren  and Armin are both dumbasses and eventually fall in love"
"My life is nothing special. My parents died when I was only 2 years of age, forcing me to live with my drunk of an uncle. I'm fucking 5 feet 2 god damn inches, and I only have 2 shitty friends. Him on the other hand, his life is so perfect and wonderful. Happy family, adored by everyone, beautifully tall, a wonderful and caring girlfriend, and eyes that look more like Gems. It's not fair... But what can I do, Kill him? I can't kill the only person I actually like. Life is so unfair. Whoever is watching my fucking short ass is doing a terrible job. They put me in almost all the same common core classes as the gem eyed prince. What makes it so much worse is that his onyx haired girlfriend is in a lot of the same classes as him as well. Maybe that's why I want to die so badly. Who knows. There's a lot of shit in the shitty world and frankly it's getting really damn annoying."
"After Eren had been saved from Kenny Ackerman, he returned home with the Survey Corps. He was fine. He was okay. So why didn’t the brat get up and vow his vengeance to kill the titans like he used to?"
"This is my first Attack on Titan one shot, so I hope you enjoy! Requests are always open, some stories may be short and I’ve been thinking about making some into their own stories. Some may have parts to them. I’m willing to write anything for the most part, so I hope you all enjoy and let me know if you’d like any to have their own stories or even more parts! This is my favourite Anime and credit goes to Hajime Isayama for the characters and some ideas used."
"It’s much safer when you only get so deep; when you keep others at a distance, always ready to pick up and leave. That’s how you stop yourself from getting hurt – right? Shallow waters, that’s how you keep the pain away. As a senior architect at Paradis Corporation, Levi is less than pleased when the other partners vote in favor of the company’s acquisition by Marleyan Enterprises. Even further pissed off when a few new faces show up at the office, one of which soon becomes a massive pain in his ass. The most annoying part in all of this: why the hell can’t he stop thinking about her? And what’s with all of the secrets and lies? Apparently, he’s not the only one running from a dark past…"
"Noblewoman Annie Leonhart has been stuck in London, waiting for her indecisive fiancé to finally organise a wedding she’s hoping will never happen. But even her dire situation wouldn’t stop Annie and her secret lover, Armin Arlert who lives hours away in Ashurst Wood, from sending love letters to each other."
"""I love you."" Coming from him, the words were meaningless. (Dark!Levi x Eren. Drabble.)"
"Life had been so simple once, spent strolling the streets of Shiganshina in peace. But at the age of ten, Valeria Weiss stood in the shadow of the Colossal Titan, she heard the screams, saw the bodies beneath the rubble; and as she narrowly escaped with her life, she came to a realisation. The end of the earth was coming."
"“If you feed a starved man, he’d eat for all the times he couldn’t—no matter how full he’d get.” You pause, finally daring to meet Levi’s face. He dares back with his callous concrete eyes, scrutinising you intently, “And what have you been starved of?” “Everything.” /Alternatively/ Erwin Smith, thirteenth Commander of humanities Survey Corps, makes you an offer you can’t refuse. An escape from The Underground, a taste of freedom. To reform your criminality, as a soldier. Freedom is all you want, you’d do anything for it, but it’s not what you get. Apparently, freedom tastes like the polish of Captain Levi’s boot."
"Unsatisfied with his current state of life, the now retired Levi Ackerman manages to travel through space and time via the paths in a desperate attempt to find his happiness, ending up in the modern era, where he finds himself tied to a relationship with the annoyingly charismatic Zeke Yeager, who is trying to navigate his boyfriend’s strange behavior after an electrical accident that possibly resulted on his memories getting scrambled."
"Eren wakes up with no memory of who he is or where he is. He's just a terrified kid, even if he doesn't show it. Mikasa and Armin lose Eren after the fall of Shiganshina and join the scouts in hopes of finding him again. And who's this annoying kid that's bugging Levi? Hange wants to adopt said kid."
"Erwin Smith meets and become obsessed with a beautiful college student Levi Ackerman, and will do anything to possess him."
"Eren was saved by a mysterious black haired man. He saves her again, but this time, he leads her to an abandoned building. There, she discovers the reason as to why her father was missing for the past one year. Her father, Dr. Yeager, holds the important evidence of the black market dealings and illegal drug tests on humans of a major pharmaceutical company he worked in. Grateful for the many good deeds that Dr. Yeager has done before, Erwin who decided to take it upon himself to protect the man's only remaining family, Eren.

After spending some time with Levi and Erwin, Eren discovers the attractive points about the two men. Erwin is gentle and kind; Levi is tough and protective. Who will she fall for in the end?"
"The world is fragile, it is such a complex and delicate structure that even the delicate and innocent fluttering of a butterfly can distort its conception to unimaginable points. Eren may not know it, but the fragility of the world is on his back. Even his love for a certain person. Aka the Eremika Royal AU vs Canonverse requested by a friend. Definitive version bc I had to delete it at morning."
"For her entire life, (Y/N) lived in the underground, hating on those who lived in the wealthy city of Shiganshina. For years, she lived a difficult life, yearning for the day she'd be able to break free from the restraints of the undercity. That is until a horrific tragedy strikes and she finds herself working with none other than topsider--and her enemy-- Hange Zoe. Will (Y/N)'s views about the topside change or will she still remain hateful towards her new ally? Inspired by the Show Arcane. All characters belong to Hajime Isayma."
"Eren wonders if it was his fault all along. Alternatively: Eren wants to help, but Levi insists on suffering alone."
"The Space Corps of Planet Eldia explores the farthest stretches of the Galaxy, engaging in missions, trading with other Planets, negotiating with other races, and, most importantly, defending Eldia and the Galaxy From Titans. The legendary Captain Levi captains the premiership in the Corps: The Expedition, alongside his First Officer and Hange Zoe, Translator Petra Ral, and the rest of his elite crew. When Admiral Erwin Smith instructs five new Cadets to finish their training with a stay aboard his crew, Levi couldn't be more irritated. However, soon upon letting the brats onto his ship, it soon becomes clear that far larger problems than mere annoyance lie in store: War is brewing, and the entire Galaxy is its playground."
"Gone are the days of being tasked to catch you, now Levi works right besides you. It isn’t long before the tinders of his deep and complicated past with you kindles into a flame once again. Both of you know there’s only one way this fire can end: in snuff or in smolder."
"Some ideas, headcanons of Erwin and Levi that make perfect sense for me. Updates whenever I get new thoughts! If you like any headcanon, feel free to use them! Of course, I will be happy to read your fanfics as well!! ⚠️: Chapters 80 to 100 are NSFW (not really tho, from my point of view they are more like semi-NSFW. But just in case maybe some people want to avoid NSFW things❤️.)"
"The man lying beside her isn't the Eren she had fallen asleep next to in the tent, nor is he the child Eren she had dreamt of prior. All hints of boyish charm are gone, his face long and angular. His hair grazes his shoulders, and his eyes no longer burn with life. She realizes this is the man Eren will soon become, though why she knows that is beyond her reasoning. Before leaving his friends in Marley, Eren takes Mikasa somewhere to explain what has to happen next"
"Everyone knows the story; how Adam cast Lilith aside for Eve. How Lucifer took her under his dark wing, only to abandon her. Her attendants have reviled his ever since, and you are no exception. But the thing about the devil is, he both tempts and destroys, as do his lieutenants. In particular, a stormy man with raven eyes. Two villains in the same story; have two wrongs ever equaled a right?"
"""It must have been awful being betrayed by a devil,"" the reporter muttered out loud, continuously gazing down the arranged paper of questions - unaware of this deep anger and resentment grumbling Levi's stomach. ""What made the Scouts go against their victory though?"" Three years after the end of Battle of Heaven and Earth, and Levi Ackerman found himself almost at peace. Well, that was until a reporter entered inside and bombarded him with questions he, himself, didn't have answers to."
"ON HIATUS “In bright reds and blazing yellows, you paint burning water. The flaming rivers come alive beneath your brush, begging to set your canvas ablaze. A tranquil inferno—much like that which resides within you.” You are an artist working for the Eldian resistance group known as the “White Star”. Following the execution of your childhood sweetheart and leader, you join forces with Yelena's Anti-Marleyan Volunteers and find your way to Paradis Island."

"Ymir demands a sacrifice. Who is Eren to deny his goddess? AOT time loop theory head canon. (How many times must we go down this Path?)"
"Perhaps in a different time I would have named us hope. Perhaps in a different universe we would not meet so battleworn And I would call us forgiveness, and not remember us as war. _______________ You’re the last thing he ever expected to find on this island. A true devil, one after his very heart. And if he’s not careful, you’re seriously going to fuck things up for him. (A Reiner x Reader retelling of canon without manga spoilers.)"
"She's the last thing he ever expected to find on this island. A true devil, one after his very heart. And if he’s not careful, she's seriously going to fuck things up for him."
"(firmly based and inspired by the film, Someone Great 2019, directed by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson. I don't own any characters from Attack On Titan, nor the plot from Someone Great) You're offered a once in a lifetime job opportunity, unfortunately, this does not bode well for your relationship with Levi."
"The world inside the walls is grim and bleak. The lives of the Scouts are death-addled and traumatized. Sometimes what you need most is to curl up in the arms and comfort of those you love most and know best."

"A narration of Hange's last moments."
"It takes a prodigious frisbee throw for Eren to realize that Mikasa's actually ambidextrous. She obliges to teach him a thing or two."
"You couldn't shake the way he looked at you. He looked at you as if you were a ghost, someone-- no, something-- sent to haunt him. It was ironic, really, that he should look at you as if you were someone long dead when you felt most alive when you were with him. So whenever his gaze met yours, you held it for as long as you dared, longing to be with him in even this insignificant way. You had a tentative friendship, but somehow being a phantom to him felt infinitely more personal. *** You had no memory of anything before you woke up in a refugee camp days after the fall of Wall Maria. Two years passed since the breach, and after going to bed hungry more often than not, you decided to join the 104th training corps so that you wouldn't starve to death. It was this series of events that led to you meeting Bertholdt Hoover. Later, you would realize how inevitable falling in love with him had been after that fateful moment when you entered the wrong barracks. And once you had began to pull on the thread that loving him had created, everything slowly unraveled. This is a rewrite of my unfinished fanfic, ‘A Girl Named Noah’. Updates frequently, no longer on a set schedule."
"the light ash brown didn't typically run on emotion, but unquestionably, when the one he cared for most was in pain, he couldn't help himself."
"He needs to tell her what he felt during all these years before it's too late."
"As an Eldian nurse in Marley, Y/N sees the end of the Mid-East war with the arrival of a patient named Eren Kruger. At the same time, her childhood friend Zeke grows emboldened as his life nears its end. Split between her past and future, Y/N is faced with the chore of navigating through the web of lies that start to rise. As another war seems to grow more imminent, she must make the choice between saving her past or following the future. (Also known as me simping for the Yeager bros and really liking the idea of a nurse AU) (Please note I do not mean Eren Kruger the 'Owl', I mean Eren Yeager, but in his Marley disguise)"
"He saw through her, and that was more than enough for her. And so, inspite of herself, she fell in love with him. But she was just someone he wants to love. Not someone he really can. Or so he thought. Or so she thought. (P.S. Ya'll might be dissuaded by the length of this.)"
"Eren Jeager seems to have it all with good grades, a good career in music and even as a college athlete. He had the perfect life with the perfect friends until his addiction to meth threatens to destroy him. The reader unexpectedly forms a really deep bond with him and tries to help him survive the addiction. But the path to sobriety was easier to be said than done."
"Death is the one thing guaranteed in life. No matter how we live, it's the one thing we are all granted at the end. Death is as much a part of life as breathing and speaking, yet no matter how much we like to believe otherwise, we are never prepared for it. And when it comes it leaves a wake of pain in all it touches but does not take. We cannot stop it, not by force, not by praying it away. We can only continue moving forward and endure. And you may call Isa Vires a fool for thinking the way forward for humanity is with the Scouts, and perhaps she is, but her fantasies of a world without titans and memories of death are enough to keep her going. However, with the Scouts, Isa soon finds the world holds far more than just death and freedom and Isa wishes to experience it all."

Does he really know the man he’s sharing a bed with as well as he thinks he does? How far is Eren willing to fall in search of the truth? Will Levi’s plans for a peaceful life with Eren go up in flames? And why is there a padlock on the basement door with only one key?"

"Armin was destined to be alone, losing everyone he loved one by one, and the thought alone had managed to etch a deep fear within his conscience. She had no idea what made him behave this way, but he was being insensitive and distant and she didn’t like it. Post Rumbling. Slight AU."

You returned to your peaceful and uneventful life, away from the hustle of the Survey Squad. Away from the friends and comrades you once had, away from Levi, the man who loved and broke you. You were a good soldier, they say. You can rest now, they say. You haven't made History, you're not dead either, but something inside you is. So when the Survey Squad returns from their successful mission, you don't interfere. You don't visit your former friends. You remain silent. Erwin notice, and he doesn't like that.

"They say that things never happen without a reason, a motive or a goal behind it. If so, then it would be nice if someone can tell me why I've been reborn into the brutal world of AOT. -Excerpt- Coming back from the dead sucks. My vision was like a fucked up, greyscale kaleidoscope for the longest time. I could only barely make out moving shapes, and it was like lots of terrifying paralysis demons looming over me. They made noises, talked to me, over me. It was indecipherable how long this went on for, but all I can remember doing for a long while was releasing cries until my throat burned, balling my eyes out like a baby.

My vision was like a fucked up greyscale kaleidoscope for the longest time. I could only barely make out moving shapes, and it was like several terrifying paralysis demons looming over me, making noises, talking to me, over me.

"Eren X Levi. They have been dating for 2 months now but Levi is acting weird. ignoring, avoiding, shouting. Eren's hurt. For how long can he stand this before he breaks down?"
"You were raped by the guy you thought you loved. Your parents were dead. What did you have left? Then your best friend returned, who you thought hated you. Can he save you? Eren X Reader. One-shot."
"For the past two years, Sasha's been gathering up the courage to confess to her long time bestfriend, Jean Kirstein. She felt like it was the perfect time to make the long waited announcement. Turns out Sha isn't the only one who has a confession to make."
"Eren has been frightened of Levi for a while now, and has no idea why. When Eren is wandering around the castle one night he bumps into Levi in the kitchen and they have a little conversation concerning Eren's fears."
"[FULL SNK SPOILERS] He loves them. He can't pinpoint exactly when it happened, but Levi had long since caught feelings and was in far too deep to get discouraged or truly disgusted by them. Hange was dirty, annoying, gross and insane in every way. Yet, he loves them. It still took him until the last day of their life before he even got close to confessing. When he calls out that stupid nickname he deemed them almost eleven years ago, the look they give is enough for him to know that he has missed his chance. He loves them, still."
"“Wait!” Armin cries, pulling Eren to a halt. Eren stares back at him with that same intense gaze that almost makes Armin want to cower. “What is it?” Eren asks. “Oh, I...I just was wondering if—” he takes a deep breath. “Yeah?” “Are we...can we be friends?” Eren rolls his eyes, and Armin’s hope momentarily shatters. “Duh,” Eren laughs—laughs!—and Armin doesn’t think he’s ever heard such a wonderful sound. “Now quit staring all bug-eyed and let’s go, or we’ll be late for dinner!” And so begins the friendship that will shatter the world."
"Eren is and will always be a fighter. Willing to put everything at risk for his own selfish wants and needs. He does things simply because he can and has the power too, regardless if the reason is understandable. He can’t escape his detrimental nature,  even if he tried, he doesn’t want too. The main goal being to create as much destruction as humanly possible. Drowning himself completely in his desire to live freely, to be bound by nothing. Until he met you. Eren being entirely succumbed by his emotions, willing to go through with desperate measures to have you. Once he makes up in his mind that he wants something, it is forever set in stone. Doing everything in his capability to have it, to claim and mark it as his own. That something just happens to be you."
"“I wanted to gift these to Moblit before he… Well."""
"""Promise me, Levi. Promise me you'll find her no matter what! The letter, It's all wrong!"" Apollo begged, eyes bleeding and mouth dripping with blood. It was a different fear Levi saw in his eyes while Apollo was being eaten alive. Not fear from the titans, but fear from a much larger thing. — Apollo, a veteran in the Survey Corps, his strength is as strong as the whole military brigade but very down-to-earth. His sudden death deeply affected not only his friends but the force of the whole regimen. Hange had acted strangely after his death. She and Apollo grew up in the same village and they already expected that she was the one who would be deeply affected. It was what Levi thought too until she showed a familiar book to them and revealed the last letter of their friend. Apollo wants to recruit her sister in the scouts and it was obvious that Hange doesn't agree with it. I mean, Apollo said she might be aggressive and rude but that's all. Why would Hange be scared and hate her? The two of them had always been a mystery. Levi, Erwin, Miche are too clueless about the current situation to even intervene. Should they put their trust in this woman?"
"I see how the titans cry And how they feel their pain But you insist to slay their breed And I would do the same. I see how the titans cry Because it was almost you The you who would the trampling us But now you lay as dust."

"Close, yet platonic. You’re almost content with having your relationship with her remain like this. Almost. ——— In which Y/N tries to suppress her growing affections for her best friend, Yelena."
"This is more of a filler of the attack on titan storyline,it won't interfere with the main plot but I will add tweaks to make it fit the standards of the readers I want to reach. It's set at the start when they are about to go to Shiganshina,from then on and up it'll be pieces here and there with a storyline that fits even after post manga. This is my favourite ship so I will try my hardest not to butcher it where the jearmin soul lives on."
"SPOILERS FOR THE MANGA ENDING Armin landed on the ground, he was laying still and stared up at the sky, he couldn’t really see through all the steam. His eyes hurt. Eren was dead. And his last words to him were ‘I really love Mikasa’? He shouldn’t be upset about that. Eren had the right to love her. Armin should be glad the rumbling had stopped and that he wouldn’t have to die in some years due to the titan curse. But he just couldn’t. He couldn’t stop his heart to fall apart. „It’s not over?...-“"
"A new virus has spread through the underground cities of the capital. 95% of the people who catch the virus would normally die. When infected your vocal cords will physically not work in any way.

So when Michi gets infected right as he’s about to go into the training corpus and is left to suffer on his own. Fast forward a few years and everything has turned for the worst. All of his friends dead. He never speaks to others unless needed. His voice grows weaker and weaker. Though being in the shadows for 4 years he finally is given more public recognition from others. At least not in the best way. “When will this hell end.” A/n: This will not have any events of the new part of season 4 I haven't caught up with it yet and please no spoilers."

"Eren goes on, flattening the world on which he stands. Only memories are there to keep him company. OR Eren remissness about his past and what could have been. He also has conversations with Jean, Connie, Levi, Annie, and Reiner."
"Freedom has never existed in the form that people imagine it to be. The idea that we make every decision ourselves is ridiculous. Fate will always be there, whether we believe in it or not. But sometimes we make a decision. A decision so unpredictable, so atypical, that it has a lasting impact on the fate of our world. That's what happened to Cassandra Winters... and the one who came before her."
"While the relationship between Levi and Erwin has slowly started to disintegrate over the years, the arrival of the latest hope for humanity in the shape of Titan-turning Eren Jeager puts everything even further on the spot when it turns out that Eren is harbouring some deeper feelings for Levi. Jealousy and possessiveness forces Erwin to realise that he needs to act if he wants to prevent Levi from falling for Eren's allure, but the questions he has to face is - what does Levi actually want and what will he do if it's already too late...."

One day, the body of a woman with singular bite marks on her neck is discovered in a park, and Levi hurries to the crime scene, sure the victim was killed by her alpha partner. However, when a special until shows up to take over the case, things take a different turn, and Levi is forced to work with a member of the new unit, an alpha and a werewolf to boot, two of the things he despises the most."
"Annie, while not much for conversation, has become a trusted listener for all of my inner thoughts and constant ramblings. Sometimes I swear I almost see her smirk when I’m particularly frustrated. Something about the darkness of the basement, and silence of my listener makes me more bold, more honest about myself and my thoughts about what has happened since the breach of wall Maria. I smile to myself, “I think Sasha has a crush on the new guy. You should see the way the two of them act around each other. I’ve never seen two people be so perfect for each other and yet so awkw-” I’m startled out of my ramblings by a low, familiar voice behind me. “Dishing out top secrets to the enemy I see?”"

"Heavy footsteps stormed close, heels clicking with each violent step. Eren whipped around the corner in a flurry of pastels. Her face was dark, cheeks flushed and eyes hard even as tears streamed down her cheeks, streaking the makeup she had so carefully applied that morning before class. “Fuck them!” she spat as she pushed past Jean with a hard, careless shove."

After a chance encounter with Levi, Eren devotes his time to help solve a crime Levi doesn’t know he committed.

"you realize briefly that even though his words are harsh and steady, there’s panic swirling behind his eyes. he’s afraid. he knows the same thing you do and yet he’s trying so hard to deny the inevitable."
"‘You know, I am so glad she rejected me. Because it proved you wrong.’ ‘..What?’ Eren doesn’t look at him, he can barely tolerate his voice. ‘The whole ‘I’m gonna sacrifice myself for her to have better life’ excuse, just so you could be an absolute piece of shit to her, without her understanding why. And now, you get to live, knowing that she didn’t choose who you expected her to choose simply because that’s the path you created for her.’ Eren grits his teeth. ‘Guess she really wasn’t a slave afterall, eh?’ In no reality should Jean think he had right to speak to him that way. And in know reality should it have made sense. Eren throws a solid punch. ----- Alternate summary; Eren does not have to use the rumbling...which defeats the purpose of everything he did to Mikasa. He believes he can accept that she  does not want to be a part of his life anymore. ...But damn it is hard."

(or, the rival violinist enemies-to-lovers AU absolutely nobody asked for)"
"“It’s your turn,” Zeke moved on, ignoring Levi’s question. “Fine,” Levi muttered, “I’ll pick a dare then.” He’d done this because he didn’t want Zeke to ask him the same question he’d asked Zeke. Of course he hated the man, especially in their past life, but he had been incredibly attracted to him back in the forest, so much so that it had irritated the hell out of him. It appeared he had a type: tall, blonde, book smart, and Zeke checked all the boxes despite being an annoying piece of shit. But picking a dare had been a mistake, as a mischievous grin appeared on Zeke’s face. Levi suddenly felt a little nervous, as Zeke was moving closer to him on the couch. He placed one hand on either side of Levi’s hips on the couch, his face close as he whispered, “I dare you to take off your pants.”"
"“You think I’m cute?” The corner of the guy’s full lips turn up as he adjusts his glasses. Levi notices an accent, though he’s not sure where from (but he’s shamelessly weak for that, too). “Mm.” Levi doesn’t grace him with a full answer, because of course he is, he fucking knows that. Yes, he’s cute, but also annoying. “Cute enough to dance with?” “Just barely, Blondie.” Levi isn't one to make return trips to his one night stands, but when his latest conquest shows up at a parent-teacher conference, he may have to make some...accommodations."
"Erwin Smith has managed to hold onto his role as the King of the Underworld longer than anyone before him, and he attributes that success to the help of his right-hand man, Levi Ackerman. The two are unstoppable forces in the godly realm, but the power balance becomes more unstable every day as younger gods try to rise up in the world. Still, Erwin has managed to stay out of the conflict and keep the Underworld solely under his control... That is... until the day arrives when he and Levi could lose everything. All for the love of a woman."

"After a battle beyond the walls, a captain paid his respect to the fallen soldiers."
"Annie and Armin are walking silently towards a green, fresh hill. Armin looks at his bride like she’s the only person who matters. He looks at her like she’s the only human, breathing, living creature he could ever be capable to love. His eyes swell and wedge, lushed together. They’re like icy, oceanic buds blossoming to reveal a whole new definition of what 'love' is. Until they reach Eren’s grave. Annie realizes that Armin is capable of loving another deceased, bashful, shameful human more than her. She looks at her groom. His face is rested. The waves gushing in shade’s are stopped, dead in their tracks. His lips are no longer smiling brightly. He’s frowning. Armin’s voice is gentle when he talks to Eren—Eren’s grave. “I love you,” he says. So sincerely. So peacefully. In a manner he had never talked to Annie before. That’s when she realized she will never replace Eren. Hell, she won’t even come near to the status Eren once was to Armin. Annie and Armin form a family after Eren’s defeat. It’s more complicated than any of them could’ve expected—and it certainly isn’t perfect."
"Mikasa wondered if it’s soaked into the way she spoke to him too. He said something or another and while she couldn’t remember what the conversation was even about, couldn’t remember what she said back to his probably innocent and non-arousing statement, her tone was by no means docile. The shock and surprise were written clearly on his face. Slaves weren’t supposed to speak to their masters that way, were they? Or Even after all the awful things Eren's done, the hurtful things he said at that table, Mikasa still somehow convinces him to take her hand and run."

Jean and Armin reconnect, and Jean soon realizes that Armin’s life has not been kind to him as he begins to develop feelings for the troubled blond who is struggling to survive."
"old habits came hand in hand with old faces - you and eren knew that all too well."
"“He’s asking to speak with you,” Came the unusually steady and thick voice from Mikasa. He’d wondered if she’d been crying. Levi raised his head and met eyes with the impossibly dark embers of the girl, who’d bulked impossibly over the past few years. The stress of Eren’s absence had worn her, causing a slight wrinkle around her eyebrows. Her eyes were always dark and aged with experience, though. “Me?” “Yes,” Mikasa replied, a bit harsher. “I won’t keep him waiting.” She turned and briskly walked towards the back, where they kept Eren locked and chained upon his arrest. Eren. - Eren and Levi are reunited on the airship."
"“What will you do when this is over?” Levi asks, absentmindedly. “I’d like to retire quietly, in the countryside. Perhaps I could write a book.”"

"''So who can blame Armin for indulging in old memories, even if many bring back the burning flames of his past? He tells himself that being selfish never got Commander Erwin anywhere, and he goes to bed surrounded by his friends who he's stuck by and survived with for what seems like an eternity. The emotion he feels can't quite be described so simply as ‘happy’, but perhaps satisfaction. Perhaps a sense of family, kinship within these people he's grown up around and in turn seen grow up. So he takes it with a stick of levity and drifts off to sleep, nestled between Mikasa and Eren like they used to as children, crowded in the same bunk fighting giggles. He likes to think he'll dream of the sea, the crashing waves filling his eyes until peace swallows him whole. '' Armin Arlert has more nightmares than he would like to admit."

"Armin feels his face twist into a snarl briefly, but when he looks at Eren, his eyes catch on his and Mikasa’s tangled hands. Hers are squirming under his grip, and then pull against her stomach in a gesture that makes Armin dizzy for a moment. He sees again that line of red, but—it’s not blood. When he sees what it actually is, he almost wishes it was. “‘M fine,” Mikasa says. Her breath is coming too fast, too shallow. “Just—cold…” Eren’s eyes shine with wonder, locked on their joint hands and what’s below them; the red spilling out from the gaps in her buttons. That is not right, Armin thinks, gut churning. That shouldn’t be happening. But at the same time, isn’t that just the same old story? *** Eren lives, and what comes after."
"“Jean is fine, Eren. I’m sure he is,” Armin sounds far away and Eren almost snaps at him, but he can’t find a voice to do so. Instead he swallows thickly and takes a shaky breath, covering his mouth with a trembling hand to prevent a sob from escaping."
"My mother once told me that if I left the farm, a horrible monster would catch me right away, before the scorching sun could kiss my skin red, or the lack of moisture on my tongue could wilt me away. Though, one day I did leave the farm. And I did it again and again.. until the thought of these beasts was just a mere whisper at the back of my brain. I went out to visit a man, one who caught my curiosity from the start."
"Sometimes the loneliness gets too much"
"""You can't do it, Historia,"" he says. He's right. She can't."
"When your gaze locked with his you could feel every bit of trauma, pain, and death behind his dark eyes. You found yourself not being able to look away, staring into his face with a shocked mien. In those few minutes of simply watching him, you knew him. You knew his every fear and his every desire. But he could also see yours. He could see how much you've been through, on purpose and on accident.. He saw everything even you didn't see. He saw the pain a mother during his era must go through.."
"NOTE: ALL CHARACTERS ARE ADULTS AND NO AGE GAPS EXCEED 3 YEARS Even though Erwin isn't dead, in many ways it still feels like he is. Levi finds himself falling apart after the reclamation of Wall Maria."
"“I hate you.” The words felt wrong yet so right on his tongue, Eren’s heart was pounding in his chest. “I will kill every single one of you. Be damned if I die while trying to.” An amused scoffed answered him before large hands firmly grabbed his hips, bringing their bodies closer. “Oh? Is that what you want, little hunter?"" Levi’s cold nose never left his neck as he breathed out the words, not sounding worried in the slightest. A shiver ran down Eren's spine. ""To stab me with your wooden stake?”"
"Four years should seem like enough time, at least that's what the two of your had told yourselves, but that's not always the case. Reiner was strong but even the strong are sometimes weak, and sometimes the strong can't seem to escape the nightmares that plague them. He was getting better, he was finally working through and finding ways to keep himself in check since coming back from war with Eldia but one small mistake sends him running to a place where he knows will ease his mind and allow him to finally push those memories back to the darkness from whence they came. The hill that overlooks the ocean, the hill where he fell in love with you and the hill that he knew you would be able to find him at."
"It's hard to love Commander Handsome when you are in Aurora Amsel's skin. This is their story."
"First, they see each other in the airport. Second, they sit next to each other on the plane. Armin and Annie didn't know they were heading to the same destination, but here they are. Armin is ready to start a new chapter in his life, but Annie isn't exactly thrilled about leaving home. Soon Annie realizes that she has a lot in common with Armin—that maybe she isn't the only one running away from something. Can a six-hour flight change Annie's mind about the future, the rest of her life, and her view on love?"

"The soft lingering touch of a doctor with a captivating laugh. The cold glare from the piercing silver eyes belonging to a vengeful mercenary. The agonising screams of the dying. The determined shouts of the living. The eternal fire that spread over the world. All of these memories potent in my mind as I take my last breath. As the saying goes 'there is often less danger in the things we fear than in the things we desire.' The selfish desires of a few leading to the downfall of many, but alas, we all still stubbornly fight to survive in this shattered world."
"Warriors weren't supposed to fall in love. It was an unspoken rule, nowhere written, but well known in everyone's minds. They had to fight, protect their country, accomplish the mission they had chosen to carry on their backs themselves.

Reiner went through that, and so did Gabi."

Returning to Wall Maria after a year-long, unsanctioned scouting mission, Alina is officially the number one most wanted person by both the kingdom's criminal underground and the military. Spending a year beyond the realm of known civilization, she has more knowledge about the world than the majority. To be killed or kept are her options, but there is one person who wants to find out exactly what's in her head and he's determined to make sure she stays alive at all costs."

But, a seed planted in your mind and was nurtured by the great Philosophers and Free-Thinkers of Greece, and that was your first mistake. Your second, was him."
"Levi Ackerman moved away from his old college mid-semester to escape past bullying and tormentation - but in doing so, he had to reluctantly leave behind many special things to him.  A personality, a hobby, and a very special friend. He left behind something he loved to him; something he let his mind escape in. Dance was his absolute passion and the only thing driving him in life, but the bullying absolutely tore Levi apart. Levi decides to put away those memories forever, never to re-live again. He escapes and moves into a new college and dorm choosing a completely new major he has no interest in, but after a disruptive night, he meets his shy but strong neighbour, Erwin. Erwin shares his old passion for dance and convinces him to join dance again, partly because he's lonely, but also to help Levi build up his confidence all over again. Erwin knows it will take time, and he claims he'll be there the whole way."
"Sometimes a little roleplay is necessary."
"“So,” says Levi. “You’ve achieved your dreams. You’ve seen the ocean. Now what?” “I don’t know,” Eren says. “I’m still deciding. What about you, Captain Levi? Once you’re done killing all the titans, what will you do?” “Who says that was my dream? Maybe when I’m done with all the other titans and bored out of my mind, I’ll just kill you.” Eren knows he’s joking, so he isn’t afraid. Behind him, Mikasa splashes pointedly and glares at Levi. He rolls his eyes. “But I suppose your bodyguard wouldn’t let me. I’ll settle for your piece of shit half-brother instead.” Eren understands, in some way. But it seems wrong for that to be his dream, too. Eren, loathe as he is to admit it, is prone to hopelessness. In his vision for the future, he wants something hopeful. Something worth waking up for. “I think… I want to make it so that everyone within the walls is safe. I want to bring everyone here. Queen Historia, and the Garrison soldiers. I want to make it so that whoever wants to, whenever they want to, they can see the ocean too.”"
"Maybe Jean was right. Maybe Eren really would die without accomplishing anything meaningful."

She bonds and is allowed just a tiny piece of the chaos that he's kept to himself for so long. What Reader doesn't know is that there's a lot more from where that came. Will Reader want to know its full extent, or will it be better for her to walk away?"
"Stumbling piss drunk out of a club and right into the hands of people hoping to hurt you was not how you intended to end your night of fun. What would you have done if Eren hadn’t shown up to save you? You were just so, so lucky that he was conveniently in the right place at the right time. Weren’t you?"
"""I kept my promise. Now it’s your turn. Come back to me.” As the Beast Titan decimates the Survey Corps at the battle of Shiganshina, everything seems lost. That is, until a twist of fate turns the tides in the Scouts' favor. However, when Erwin is gravely wounded in the aftermath, Levi has no choice but to use the serum and face the consequences. As the residents of Paradis grapple with the truth of the Titans and the shifting realities of their world, nothing is quite what it seems... Set at the end of Season 3/Chapter 80ish of the manga, this story explores what might have happened had Erwin survived the mission to retake Wall Maria."
"Eren doesn’t know how he ended up in the Undercity. He doesn’t know who his parents are, or why steam comes out of his wounds, or why he can lift things twice his size with ease.

"That bespectacled girl has once approached him, and he decided to push her away. She did nothing but only hoping to become good friends with him, and he was hoping totally the opposite. ""Go away."" Was always his final say and he left her there pondering. She knew how much impossible for a muted girl like her to get the attention of the hottest man in their Junior High, still. . . Hange Zoe has no reason to give up yet. So she ended up just watching him, from afar. And continued with that habit until both of them achieved their own successful carrier. Levi Ackerman, the man who silently stole her heart, but she could only express her true feelings for him through little hand gestures. With hope that one day, Levi will try his best to understand."
"Before a vicious attack to the capital of his nation's biggest enemy, Marley, Armin Arlert reflects on his own past and future."
"A twitch of the little girl’s finger, and the sound of an explosion and a bullet piercing flesh slammed into everyone’s ears. A spray of blood shot out behind him. A single exhale, a slight gasp of surprise. The sound of a thud as a body hit the ground. The girl looked shocked, which seemed odd. Hadn’t she known what would have happened if she’d pulled the trigger? Conny turned around. Maybe she’d hit one of the others. His eyes widened and his breath turned to stone in his lungs."

It was his fault for letting Erwin order him to stay behind. He should’ve argued harder, he should’ve… The story of Erwin returning home without his arm and Levi losing his mind."

Or: Jean follows Eren and Mikasa's relationship as they evolve from twelve-years-old to nineteen, realizing how much he cares for them in the process, and how willing he is to gulp down the turmoil of his inner feelings and the outpouring adoration —if that means that they shall be, forever, happy together."

"In which Eren is the teenage shifter who has a shitty home life, anger issues and a society that actually hates him (not in that order) and Levi is the older, badass cool kid with a penchant for smoking and not taking in strays. Unfortunately Eren happens to be the exception, when they meet one winter morning outside Trost High and Levi discovers to his dismay that he does have a heart... But in a world where shifters are discriminated against and people from Levi's background are only ever going to go down, it's unlikely that either are going to make it very far. Really, it's just a matter of time."
"“Promise me you’ll come home.” “I promise.” “Pinkies?” A chuckle leaves Reiner’s lips as he wraps his pinky finger gently around yours. “Pinkies.” “You better come back, Braun. I mean it.” You try to give him your toughest glare, but it just makes him laugh harder. He squeezes your pinky finger a little harder and smiles at you one more time before boarding the ship bound for Paradis. Your Reiner is leaving. He’ll be back. He has to come back. You knew that he would be fine, but the anxiety in your heart won’t settle."
"Levi could see this was going to be one hell of a language barrier between them as he lifted his hands up in what he presume was a non-threatening gesture. The action only made the creature quickly get on all four his ears pointed forward his tail up and swinging side to side in complete aggression. “It's alright, you're hurt.” Levi wasn't big on talking or it was more like he couldn't express himself very well with words alone. The kid had the most gorgeous voice his ears has ever had the pleasure of hearing...it was soft low, but crystal clear with a strong rolling accent of words he couldn't understand. “My name is Levi.” Levi spoke to him thinking an introduction was the right thing to do at the time."
"Guns are made for final decisions, not second guesses. You pull the trigger, there are no regrets. There's always something on the other end, receiving the bullet. You can either look firmly ahead as you take another man's life, or bite the dust. Only the trigger has the answer. Levi Ackerman learned this while he was on the run after murdering his best friend and wife for having an affair behind his back. Traveling through towns, meeting countless people who always had a story to tell over a glass of whiskey and a smoke, and that one shitty brat he met in some shitty town who just couldn't leave him the hell alone."
"All that could be heard was their moans and grunts as well as the sound of skin slapping against skin which were becoming louder. He had his legs wrapped around Eren's waist urging him to go deeper. Both of them were lost in the feeling of utter bliss. Nothing else mattered."
"Eren hates vampires with a passion. They nearly killed someone extremely close to him and he's not going to forgive them for it. One day during one of his midnight strolls, he meets a stranger. This stranger could prove to be more dangerous than he'd like to have thought. The stranger's name is Jean Kirschtein, a vampire who instantly pisses Eren off. Eren wants nothing to do with this guy. But much to his dismay, Jean is going to take everything that Eren's always stood for and throw it in the trash."
"Levi is content with silence, content with the sound of rain. The same sound that drowns out every silent cry, every dry tear, every unspoken word at the tip of his tongue. The pain is unbearable, but he doesn't let emotion slip through that mask of indifference he's kept up for all these years. His face still remains devoid of any emotion other than detachment. Yet, he wants to feel. Wants every cut to hurt more than just bleed. He wants to tear away at his flesh until there is nothing left of it. Pain seems to be the only way to relieve the guilt eroding his mind. But now, Levi is far gone. Lost in his own darkness. Can a certain bright-eyed brat help Levi find his way back into the light?"
"""Hange Zoe doesn’t miss much from before. She doesn’t miss the walls. She doesn’t miss the restrictions, the corruption amongst those who were supposed to protect and serve. She doesn’t miss the titans. (Well, she does a little.) One thing she does miss, though, is waking up to see the sky. """
"Levi isn't sure if he made the right decision, choosing Armin over Erwin."
"“Run away with me.” Eren says suddenly, sitting up and holding Mikasa’s hands. “I may not have much, but I promise you I’ll give you whatever you want and need.” “I don’t need anything but you.” Mikasa mumbles, causing Eren to smile rather foolishly. “And yes, yes I will.”"
"Levi had woken up from a coma of two years. His student Eren Jaeger seems devastated that he lost his memories."
"Jean has been in a relationship with this abusive bastard for three fucking years. Three years of pain and tears and nobody to go to, when Marco Bodt decides to waltz into Jean's life, it's certainly a shock. Nobody would suspect such a colorful person could be so cruel, but Marco does, but will he be able to save Jean?"
"None"

And while the blond continues to confuse her, there’s a sort of relief she provides even if it’s growing smaller and insignificant as the months go by. The warmth Ymir felt for her has been slowly ebbing away, leaving a cold emptiness in its place. But Historia chooses Ymir. And for now, that's enough."
"They lie there, listening to each other reset. - Jean and Reiner are not left without tears, without pain, without scarring and trauma. They will never be without the shadow of nightmares. Just because everything is over does not mean everything is done."
"All it takes is pure chance for a blow to the head to mean forgetting anything from minutes to years, something one never thinks will happen to them. And then it does. If they're lucky, maybe a few days are gone. If not... Either Eren has some extraordinarily good luck or a brilliant guardian angel, but it still doesn't make life easy."

Levi refused, as he did not want to get forced to marry a girl he didn't even love, but unfortunately, knows that he must or the two kingdoms could go to war. But what happens when Levi meets a young boy at the gathering in which he is to meet Petra? In the midst of the mayhem of dealing with his parents and trying to get somewhat closer Petra, he finds himself falling further and further in love with the young boy, who is named Eren. But not only was the love forbidden, for Levi was a prince and Eren a commoner, but the wedding with Petra was something that would absolutely not be avoided."
"People fall in love everywhere. And for Levi, it was on the bus. People fall in love everywhere. And for Eren, it was on the bus. And people fall out of love. And it can be on the bus. And people can re-find love. And it can be on the bus. And love can last forever. And it can be on the bus. {They go more places than the bus I promise}"
"Hearing the words, ""we'll meet again in the next life,"" suddenly felt like his whole world was shattering around him."
"I'm feeling compromised, and so dehumanized I can't feel my face, I wont struggle on In a world so cold, in a world so wrong I'm not running away, been fighting this for so long Such a price that we pay, we gotta be so strong"
"Marco Bodt has just begun college at Trost U, and moves into a dorm where his dorm mate has yet to show up. After witnessing a beautiful man get in a hideous argument at Little Titan Cafe, he goes back to his dorm only to find that he is his new dormmate. Jean Kirschten, he calls himself. Will Marco's college days be ruined by Jean's rude attitude towards him and everyone else? or will Jean warm up to the Tall Freckled Dork and form a new close relationship?"
"Levi had had a difficult childhood, he had seen his companions die devoured by titans and could no longer find a reason to continue living. Erwin selfishly proposed to be the motivation to keep fighting. When he said ""Give your hearts"" to the soldiers he asked them for a sacrifice. But when he said ""Give your heart to me"" to Levi, it had a completely different meaning. Erwin and Levi, in difficult moments, they always found comfort in each other, and not only that.

"Porco brings you a housewarming gift, listens to Conan Gray, gets drunk and warms something else"
"They would have taken him eventually. The ultimatum they had given Erwin had spoken volumes. They might have needed the Legion to continue exploring the outside world and eradicating any Titans that might have remained beyond the reaches that they had explored but they did not need one particular Commander. No, he could have been replaced, quite easily, and likely with someone who would be more easily manipulated. One who sat in the palm of the Military Police. It was either him or Eren together or Eren alone. For Eren, there had been no way out. Death had awaited him no matter what."
"It's enough of a burden to deal with one life, let alone two. Even worse when you find an old lover from the last one who doesn't remember it - not consciously anyway. But that doesn't matter to Erwin. No, as long as Eren is by his side, memories or not, he'll be content to hold him close and hope he never has to remember those horrors."
"Eren's still pissed, and so is Jean."
"Levi is a 26 year old who is stable on his feet,  but one day after his best friend sets him up on a blind date he meets a bright eyed brat. Yukio okumura who is also a friend of Levi happens to meet the bright eyed brat in a chance encounter.  With Eren conflicted about who to choose he chooses wrong and finds out Yukio is emotionally detached sometimes. With one relationship that failed will Eren want to start over fresh. Giving his heart over to Levi is that the only decision he can make? In love you make the choice that you will regret the least. Will Eren make that choice or is safe to say that fate has lamentations mapped out for the rest of his life."
"The market was busy at this time of day, people rushing past her, the sounds of everyday life washing over her comfortably. She had no haste and let herself relish the blooming spring. Gabi now allowed herself to appreciate things as they were. Small moments. The little things. Ordinary everyday life."
"Eren had a dream one night. And like the accidental idiot he tends to be, he talks to his Corporal about it. Openly chastising, but silently intrigued, Levi finds himself wondering about it later that night. Only his dreams will tell the tale of a role reversal of epic proportions. *Fixed the tags, because I was an idiot!*"
"You work in the scout regiment, organizing and leading many areas of the scout's work, including interrogating prisoners. When you're tasked to interrogate a new prisoner, who happens to be someone you once loved, things quickly get heated."
"“I love you. Holy Sina, you know I’m not lying about that, don’t you?” When she looks at him he suddenly realizes she might not actually know. But that’s not what she says. She says, dully and with profound sorrow, “I wouldn’t be your first beloved you’d destroyed. Would I?”"

Unknown to the residents of the house, this slave will upend the rituals pressed upon them by society and change everything they've come to know. The troubled Master doesn't stand a chance when faced with the boy's oceanic gaze and hard determination. ***Non-con is short-lived and mostly in the past***"

"Eren's relationship with Levi isn't how he imagined it would be."
"Armin Arlert is a regular freshman at a college in New York. Annie Leonhart is the terrifying woman he falls madly in love with. They're both fucked up in their own way, but they each might be just the thing the other needs."
"Eren and Levi have been married for three years. They have a stable life, careers, and can afford most anything they want. The only thing they don't have yet have come to desire - a baby. Sasha who works as a group therapist for teen girls. Introduces them to a girl who wants a better life for her unborn child. Due to awful circumstances regarding her impregnation and the situation she is stuck in."
"Drabble Collection for Warriors Week 2022!"
"Hange knew she messed up. She knew everyone hated her for doing it. Levi is mad at her. But he could never explain how he feels."
"Mikasa had been working on a project. When Erwin came across the project once more, he realized he could actually finish it. It was when he began to add on all the features that would make it look human that he realized he had the power to bring her back again."
"Even though Hange loves him, there's already someone in Levi's heart. Someone that isn't, and will never, be her. ""Love is not demanded or begged for; it’s given freely. It progresses naturally. It’s a fire that lits without much incentive and burns everything in its path. Forced it withers and drowns. Ends without starting. That’s why they were never going to work out."" Angst/Some fluff/ Unrequired Love (or is it?)"

"Eren is dependent upon Levi to protect him and Levi betrays his trust. Even so, Eren stays around and waits for the Corporal to admit to his feelings. Levi doesn't necassarily trust Eren until is possibly too late. The night changes everything and nothing worse could happen...could it?"
"Levi has been giving Erwin the cold shoulder. When Erwin discovers why, will he be strong enough to keep going? Will Levi?"

"Coming home from a war and readjusting to civilian life can be hard on any soldier, but at least they don't have the added baggage of coming home to a different century. Armin Arlert, Captain America, is trying his hardest to get back in the world, but how can he when he left his best friend behind?"

That, and his growing feelings for Jean."
"Levi, stoic and apathetic, is heir to the crown of France. Mikasa, bearing the same dull emptiness, is a daughter of Germany and Levi's betrothed. However, when Mikasa and her company of men and women arrive at the Tuileries Palace, it's not his beautiful bride-to-be that Levi notices, but her bastard brother, Eren.

"Levi x reader oneshot!"
"In an alternate universe, Eren, Mikasa and Armin just transferred to a university after taking two years of community college classes in their hometown. Finally feeling grown up and independent, they move into their own apartments, but in the same building of course. While studying, partying and catching up with old friends, Eren and Mikasa chase sparks between them, while Jean fights for her attention."
"Eren was never one to focus on relationships. He was always zeroed in on his grades, much like his best friend, Armin, and shied away from strangers. He never went to parties or the school dances; he was antisocial. When news of a certain quarterback joined the football team at the end of his Freshman year, Eren couldn't help but develop a small crush on the raven-haired man. His Sophomore year rolled around and he desperately tries to tell himself that there's no way a popular Junior like Levi could ever like a nerd such as himself. It wouldn't work out. Plus, they were both male. That was wrong, right? There was no way Eren could date Levi. Right?"
"Like the cold blades you carry into battle, you will shatter, only to be reforged again."
"Levi watched as the titan picked Eren's mother up from the debris. One move and he could cut the nape of the titan's neck and save Carla, but he didn't move a muscle, instead choosing to watch the titan eat the woman. He smiled, wanting nothing more than to see Carla get eaten by the monster so that she couldn't keep Eren from him anymore. He'd remove everyone in his way in order to have Eren all to himself. But, as years pass by, the young adult's interest to join the survey corps becomes yet another obstacle."
"Tall, blonde Captain Erwin Smith is the perfect method to extract funds from noblemen’s desperate wives and when the Survey Corps bring in dirty, bedraggled, beautiful Levi with his promiscuous glares, this method of funding seems to have a long and virtuous future. Levi seems to have no problem, and even prefers serving men whilst Erwin shudders at this vulgarity, but as he is promoted to Commander and his prostitution ceased, he finds himself becoming intrigued by the practice of this homosexuality, and by Levi."
"We all know that Levi is humanity's strongest, and that he's been through some tough shit. This love story takes place in the modern world, and it shows Levi's emotional and mental struggles and changes as he slowly grows close to Eren - something he had hoped he never would. Levi used to work in a kindergarten (and he wasn't a big fan of it). Twelve years later he's a librarian in a high school. Eren Jaeger is a 2nd grade student, and also one of the children he watched in kindergarten. And guess what, Levi somehow ends up having to babysit this brat for five weeks because the kid broke some rules (and by babysitting, I mean Eren has to help Levi clean the library). They can't stand each other at first, but after a while, they somehow get to each other. Brat or no brat, Levi has no idea what an emotional ride awaits him."
"When Levi was a teenager, the unrequited love of his life was Eren, his best friend's father. Fifteen years later, Levi finds himself back in Whitecrest Cove to sell his late uncle's house. This story was mostly written for Ereri Week 2015."
"Eren is a 3rd year in high school already and is looking back at his high school life, dreading the uncertain future. Until one day he visits an university that his counselor recommends and runs into a peculiar sensei~"

"Reiner reminisces. The good and the bad."
"Uncertainty threatened to turn him away. 'I'm pushing my luck. Fuck it, I've pushed it so much. I shouldn't. I need to. Dammit! Dammit, dammit, dammit! Just do it! Just go in and finish it! Or do you want to be worthless? Useless? A failure again, but this time to your family?' Desperation drove him forward."
"You have the Mark of Cain but Eren won't let the Mark destroy you and who you are , just because you have to kill Abaddon."

"Life is unfair. That’s what you’ve always known, so you fought back against it. Which leads you to where you are now, on a battlefield with people you’ve only known for a while. Will you be able to save everyone or will it all end in a massacre?"
"Levi has always hated the hero names the public has come up with for him. 'Humanity's Strongest,' he despised. 'Captain' wouldn't have been so bad, if it weren't so blatantly coined off of Erwin's hero name, 'Commander.' Of course, now they're calling him the fucking 'Wings of Freedom.' Wings of Shit, Levi thinks bitterly. The post-MHA AU no one asked for. In the era after Deku's generation, Levi struggles to harness his quirk as he and Erwin lead the Survey Corps hero agency against the growing titan threat. Featuring the veterans both as teenagers and adults."

"Worried about their boyfriend's mental health, Levi and Erwin decide to try something incredibly risky in an attempt to help him."
"ABANDONED FOR GOOD. -- It's a thin line between love and hate is what they say. It ain't easy being teenager and trying to cope with sexual frustration, finding your identity in the ever-changing world, and realising that the person who pisses you off more than anything else in the world is the person of whom you dream even when awake. So basically Jean hates Eren until one day something happens, and he's left confused about his own sexuality, feelings for Eren and other teenager-y shit. Existential angst at its best. High school! au that is so unoriginal that it hurts."

However it appears Eren Jaegar is immune to the virus and so he goes on a journey with none other than a grumpy short man named Levi to discover the secrets of the weird dreams he's been having."
"I did my best not to let my insecurities show to anyone. I kept them inside, locking them away behind bars made of iron. I swallowed any evidence that might have given me away, even as I asked her to marry me. I can’t even pinpoint when I began to develop these feelings. Was it just my anxiety? Or was this something more? Did I still love her? Was I still in love with her? She was the most understanding, thoughtful, kind-hearted partner I’ve ever had, and yet I still felt this way. God, what is wrong with me? Or where Eren is a college student and begins to doubt his relationship with his fiancée, the feelings only getting worse as he meets someone new."

"Levi turned his focus outside the window to the foggy horizon and watched the rising sun. ""It looks like a sea of molten silver,"" Eren said. ""I wish it were a sea of molten silver."""
"Eren was good. He went to church each Sunday, he was able to control his anger issues, and had decent grades even with his short-attention span. He loved his family and his God more than anything else in his life, and despite wanting to be travel the world, Eren knew that he would eventually follow his father and become the next pastor of Shiganshina's church. Until he met Levi, and began to question everything he had ever done. Eren had always been certain that disobeying God - that sinning - was wrong. But if it was, then why did it feel so good? When he sneaked out to see Levi, when Levi convinced him to drink alcohol, when Levi kissed his cheek - Eren had never felt more alive in his life. By the time he noticed, Eren was far too gone to even care that Levi was ruining his innocence. [Do not re-upload to another site]"

"Levi reminds Eren what it means to be human."
"Levi stared at Eren without muttering a single word. His grey eyes were burning holes in his body, and a shiver ran down Eren’s spine. It was unnerving to have the man right there, so close and yet so far from him, so distant and silent."

Things start to look up for Jean. And as the saying goes, life gets better. But then again, as some people handle situations, some situations handle people. Shadows of the mind is about the struggle of living with depression/anxiety and how much of an effect it can have on a person's life and to see if teenage romance can overcome the crushing pressure of one's mind, whether it can be a light to banish the darkness.And I want to make this clear, depression is not romantic in any way and it is not my intention to romanticize depression/anxiety in any way. if I have gone about it the wrong way please let me know. Gods bless. Told from Jean's P.O.V"

"They all knew this day was coming. They finally defeated all the titans… Well not all of them."
"“Everyone’s gone to their cabins,” Eren said, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. In the dim light of the candles, Levi could see the faint blush on his cheeks. His lips stretched in a tiny smirk. Eren had never been good at being subtle. “Why haven’t you?” he asked, raising an eyebrow. “Wasn’t tired yet.” Eren bit his bottom lip and Levi would have given him everything he had in that moment, but he had nothing to offer him, so he simply put down the cup of tea and stood up. “Come,” he said, and headed to his bedroom."
"Erwin and Levi met when they were barely ten years old. It was a deal between their old men. Mr.Smith had felt guilty for neglecting his relationship with his son and Kenny felt it was too risky to try and raise his sister's kid in the pits of the underground. So, an agreement was made. Levi would get off his uncle's back and Erwin would gain a companion to play with. Nothing more, nothing less. EDIT: Holy shit, we reached 200 kudos, ok I have a moral obligation to update now"
"At the prestigious Maria University of Music, Dorm 104 turns out to be a High School reunion for some of the recent graduates of Sheena's Academy for Gifted Musicians. Toxic histories collide, and nothing is what it seems. Mikasa Ackerman is an aspiring musician, looking for the boy who saved her the night her parents were murdered, leaving her only with his red scarf. Annie Leonhart is simply trying to get away from her father, who only wants her to fight, who doesn't even know about her band, The Outcasts.

He cares about his friend, but doesn't want to lose him, and he's afraid that his friend might get into trouble with his bad temper."
"In a world where your soul mates name is on your right wrist, not having a name there sort of really sucks. But what sucks more is when your great great grandmothers’ spirit has taken a stake in your love life. But see, that’s not the point. The point of the matter is that college, hormones, and meddling spirits were really hard to manage all at once. Not to mention rebels and political upheaval. But none of that compared though. What made things really difficult was, during all of that, I was falling in love, and that? That was the hardest part."
"The new assignment on the capture of mafia boss, Zeke Yaeger has been taking a toll on Levi. Coming home to her has been his salvation."

"Year 854 - One Week Before Liberio. Mikasa is a contradiction, in so many ways.  The strongest of them is the most fragile and prone to crumbling. The most placid of them has emotions churning wildly beneath the surface, threatening to overwhelm her. The bravest of them is the one whose dreams leave her whimpering in her sleep - begging Eren Jaeger to come home. Manga Spoilers Ahead..."
"His eyes brimmed with tears when he spotted him through the windows. He hadn’t changed much, but at the same time, he was different. Although the scars didn’t fade, only uneven rosy and white-ish lines remained. Levi kept his right eye uncovered, but he wore some kind of prosthesis for his two missing fingers -no doubt. Hange’s doing-. But apart from that, he was just the same. With more wrinkles and greys, but his clothes were pristine, and instead of his cravat, he had added an apron to his attire. Levi looked as beautiful as ever."

"During the late 18th century, France is stuck in a constant state of civil war. with the Jacobin's reign of terror still going strong, it seems unlikely that the situation will get even remotely better. When Commander Erwin Smith’s right hand man, Levi Ackerman, goes undercover to spy on the revolutionaries, he meets Eren Jaeger, a revolutionary planning to overthrow Erwin. their worlds collide in ways they never expected they would. To make it short: it’s really loosely based of Les Miserables, where Levi is sort of like Javert but not an ass and Eren is Marius."
"AU. Life was happy when you're a kid, Eren thought. Everything was simple and he had a friend named Levi. But as an epidemic sweeps across the country, he realized that he was caught between his conflicting emotions for his friend that left him, and for the consequences he was about to face when he decided to follow him."
"The hissed words barrelled to the forefront of his mind, a conversation from years past recalled so clearly he could almost let himself drown in the wild delusion that she was stood right there beside him, a shadow speaking from beyond a common soldiers grave."
"""Hey,"" he greets unceremoniously, not even sure at this point what it is he wanted to accomplish. If he was going to be completely honest with himself, he really just wanted to see her. She seemed to understand what was going on in his mind. She always knew.

"""He never was good at keeping things alive, anyway."" Levi learns to mourn."
"An early morning moment between Levi and Eren."
"Eren's liked Jean since he laid eyes on him, and lately Jean's been feeling butterflies whenever he looks into Eren's eyes. Sadly, neither of them can work through these dumb boy feels they have for each other and continue to bicker and fight. Lots of sexual tension, fights, blushing dorks, and confessions about their feelings for one another."

"A small one shot to the day before the ambush to Paradis. A promise that was not fulfilled."
"Her shoulders drop, suddenly empty with feeling. The sight sparks something else in Mikasa; she doesn’t think its jealousy, perhaps it is something more akin to sadness or loneliness. She watches as Niccolo twines his hands with Sasha’s, how Eren is playing with the ends of Armin’s golden hair – and wishes that it was her. She heaves a sigh, marred with discontent and bitterness, raising the rifle once again with haste and falling back into her usual posture for shooting. Desperately, she pushes down all the nonsensical thought and feelings bubbling up within her, quick to quash the intensity of them before they morph into something else. She clenches her teeth and aims down the sights, and fires. Direct hit. Mikasa wants and longs for people that she cannot have."

"This story follows Eren Jaeger from 1989 to 1990 as he struggles with coming to terms with what he's been through and still is. Prostituting himself to men comes with dangers and plenty of self-neglect and he expects Erwin Smith to treat him just like any other John. However, though fond of bland missionary intercourse, Erwin pays well and Eren sticks around; eventually meeting the man's friend going by Levi who doesn't seem one bit interested in the boy. Juggling his personal life with that of trying to be there for his mother, Eren's eventually forced to face his inner demons and make a change.

"Hange and Levi made it to the orphanage.  Barely.  As Levi tries to recover from the injuries he sustained, Hange knows that, mentally, Levi won't recover at all.  He won't be okay--not even a little bit. Times like these leave Hange to wonder where they went wrong, where they go from here.  What could they do now, with their best friend broken like he was? An unlikely help is Historia, who seems to know more about the captain than Hange realised.  She has an idea as to how they move forward, and is ready to put it into motion."
"This is a spin-off series of ""Walking Dogs And Shitty Jokes"", told from Levi's point of view: Nothing was going his way. Levi swore that someone upstairs was playing a cruel joke on him, to put him so close to something he could never have. But Levi stayed, because he couldn't lose any more people he cared about. That was when Levi decided to walk the dog through the park so he could smoke for just a little bit longer. That was also when Levi met... him."
"-It all starts with Eren.- After the sudden death of both of his parents, fifteen-year-old Eren Jäger not only is forced to move in with a family friend he's never heard of, let alone has ever even met before, but as well suffers from terrifying hallucinations. Though the reclusive and rather creepy Levi is not at all an ideal candidate to be taking care of the teenager, they're stuck with one another in a single cabin in the woods for the next three years. A (psychological) horror fic, about a grieving and disturbed boy falling for a man who seems to have sinister intentions as he continuously sucks Eren in as much as he pushes him away; at times with brute force."
"The night before and after the return to Shiganshina."
"Eren, a headstrong teenager that deals with his abusive father and has to scrounge for money any way he can to pay for his adoptive sisters education, and Levi, a well paid editor at a prestigious publishing company, who is a total clean freak with a foul mouth and has very little tolerance for the general population. The two very different people lead two very different lives despite their similar back story. They would have gone about their their bleak lives never thinking they could find comfort in another person, until their worlds collide and each of them are changed forever."

"[Rewriting in progress] A friendship formed by indirect circumstances, profound as it is heavyhearted—will change both of them for the better or worse."
"Jean Kirschstein is 19 years old, lives alone, has a boring part-time job at an organic grocery store, has four friends in the whole world (not including his dog), goes through life day after day with very little change, and has absolutely no impact on anyone or anything. Oh and he talks to ghosts. That's kind of important."
"Eren's changed recently. Mikasa isn't sure she likes it but he's still the boy she loves. Even if his actions are becoming more evil everyday."
"Tomorrow, they will venture to retake Wall Maria. Tonight, Levi wonders if the ocean is as blue as Erwin's eyes. The funny thing about all of this nonsensical sentimentalism is that Levi knows Erwin doesn’t love him. Hell, Levi isn’t entirely sure that Erwin is capable of romantic love, or any kind of love, really. But that has never been a problem for Levi. Erwin may not love him, but Erwin understands him. Their relationship has always been based on precisely that: understanding. The fact that Levi is, after all, in love with him is trivial."
"After the war is won and the remaining Levi Squad retires from the military, Eren receives a parting gift from a friend as he leaves. He keeps a portrait of her on the mantle above the fireplace in the living room. Not in his bedroom, he'd see it too often. But in the living room so that he may cut his eyes toward her on his way in and out the front door. Heading out, Ma. I'm home, Ma. In the living room above the fireplace so that she may forever reside warm and safe above the flickering embers in the hearth, kept under his watchful eye where no one can hurt her. Not again."
"Titans roam the outside world striking fear in the hearts of many. Ghouls hide amongst the humans. Both species opponents in a flesh-eating war that never seems to end. Eren is the victim of cruel experiments that he has no memory of cause his body to change and develop into something more than human. Or an Attack on Titan/Tokyo Ghoul crossover in which an older Eren pisses Levi off to no end."
"Note: SPOILERS through the end of the third season! Bertholdt Hoover's last memory was of falling in the battle to retake Shiganshina.  When he wakes up in a dark, cold room with his arms and legs missing and a female Corps member telling him to be quiet, Bertholdt is terrified, but it turns out she's actually saving him from a horrible fate.  They both have to make sense of what happened and find their way out of the city."

"""Wonder what we could be living in another life; catch us in the mirror and it looks a lot like love."" An unfortunate accident, as well as obvious differences in ideologies, made hating the newest recruit of the Survey Corps so easy. But time proved that falling in love with him was actually even easier. The seemingly lost world, though, taught you that loving him was complicated. And a twist of fate made leaving him by far the hardest part."
"Forced to share bunks, Eren gets pissed at Jean for singing (badly) in his sleep. Survey Corps get a day off and the two have to spend it together. And then they're forced to clean the stables at night. Oh,  how the world hates Eren and Jean, but not as much as they think. [Indirect sequel]"

"You stumble across Levi and Hange unexpectantly in the forest where you live. Whilst you care for an injured Levi, will feelings grow?"
"Caraphernelia; A broken-heart disease whenever someone leaves you but leaves all their things behind. Levi's an asshole, Eren knows, in the same way he knows that he should not have let his hopes up; though he still can't help the crack he definitely feels and hears inside is chest as he leaves, and nobody follows him. He knew this would happen; he wast too much of an idiot to accept it sooner and spare himself the pain. Now he has to live with the consequences that come with dating (or attempting to date) someone like Levi."
"He didn’t look like how he should. Eren Jaeger was successful. He was a MLB prospect. He was everything that this Eren wasn’t anymore. His friends back home probably wouldn’t even recognize him like this."
"Eren's thoughts after learning of Sasha's death."
"The first time he remembers is the moment Erwin's heart stops beating. For a split second, a sharp pain races through his head, leaving him dizzy and faint. What follows is a brutal, overwhelming onslaught of memories – memories of a future that is yet to come. Or memories of a time long past? It's all fragmented, distorted, chaotic. When Levi opens his eyes again, he sees the world in a new light. It's like he has woken up from a long dream. “Are you alright?” asks Hanji, their voice broken and hoarse. They look at him with concern. It is a stupid question, really, and they both know. Because nothing is alright any more. ***** My entry for the 2019 Eruriweek Prompt: Timeloop"

Among these warriors is Princess Eren Jaeger's secret husband, Levi, so when none of the soldiers return to the kingdom, she takes it upon herself to find him, but perhaps she won't, and maybe she has truly lost it all."
"... Once the wall titans break free from their prison, devestation and terror devours the world. In the midst of it all, Eren tells Armin one last thing he needed to do in order to end the war once and for all. One question is certain; How far are he and Mikasa willing to go? [Post 121]"
"There's no real reason or logic to explain it. But if Levi has to come up with something, he'd settle for a shrug and a ""That's just how life is."" It's far neater than explaining about his previous life as ""Humanity's Strongest Soldier."" So if you can stop laughing, Eren, Levi would really appreciate it."
"The battle of Shiganshina wore the scouts thin. You and Levi met in the underground and went through everything together since then. Haunted by grief and trauma from your lives, you try your best to take care of those around you in spite of everything you’ve gone through. In his own way, Levi tries to keep you safe from the horrors of your world only for the two of you to struggle and endure loss after loss."

"Levi is Done with the world around him, sick of being secondary and forever unable to find a place where he feels appreciated as a person. Living alone, avoiding everyone in sight is how Eren has decided to atone for the failures in his life. Somehow they find themselves in each other in a way they hadnt found in anyone before.

"Podfic of starsinew's 'these clothes don't fit us right' - They are tin soldiers, steadfast and gleaming bright in the somnolent afternoon sun, and time hasn’t slowed for them but suspended- this is his now just as it is his forever, and Eren knows he can love.

"Nile wasn't ready to let go of Erwin when the day came that they had to go their separate ways."
"Growing up, Eren's mother had told him he couldn't go outside Shiganshina because his village was different from the rest of the world. She said the world wouldn't understand him because he was special, and that made it dangerous. But Eren wanted to see what lies beyond the only place he's ever known. He could never have imagined that one day his mother's warning would be proved right in the most horrifying way, showing him the darkest side of the human world. Is Eren fated to spend his life as a caged animal?"

Or so the story goes. In truth, Eren doesn't know what's wrong with him. His girlfriend does nothing for him, and it's getting to a point where he can't even perform the way she wants. He should be able to, by all accounts, his girlfriend is hot, and he's not so bad himself. It just won't work, nothing works. And then he meets his adopted sister's cousin, and it all makes sense. Eren is seventeen, Levi is eighteen. This is a very smut-heavy fic, too. Give a teenager a willing partner, and well, you know what happens."
"It’s been two years of new developments and new allies for the people of the walls; but for one person- It’s been two years of hell. The world seemed to be bleak, it’s colored drained and muted. A lone black horse and it’s solemn rider made their way to pair of houses not yet touched by man. Had the sacrifice been worth it? One hundred and ninety nine lives lost in a suicide charge and for what? For the Attack Titan to turn on its allies and flee their home; never to be seen again.

Levi is in the award-winning, incredibly famous rock band King Raven with his fellow band-members Marco and Farlan. But, despite all his fame and fortune, he feels lost. That is until a certain bright-eyed boy rescues Levi from himself. Gifted to 2 legends that read this and for some reason wanted more"
"Future AU. Marco was once a rebel, who was taken by the government for speaking out. Jean, who lost his best friend and soul mate, joined his former group to avenge him. It's been five years. One of the government's top soldiers has been captured by the resistance. He looks just like him, sounds just like him, and Jean wants to believe that he's the same person.

"The walls have been torn down, government disbanded and titans exist no more, only to be replaced with supernatural creatures. An unofficial sequel to Selfish Desires. AlphaxOmega Chapter 9 and 10 will have LevixArmin themes."
"Eren is nearly silent, and for once, she is glad. He is under her—pliant, sweat gathering on his brow and the base of his neck, mouth agape with quiet gasping breaths as she fucks him; a hand planted squarely in the centre of his chest as she drives her hips forward."
"Two people taking care of each other. Giving comfort."
"The head of treasury glances at them. Hanji smiles and waves while saying “fuck you” in a tone that sounded like “hello”. It certainly wasn’t Bonjour, and the expression that formed on the head of treasury’s face indicated that he thought that exact thing for a moment. Since he clearly doesn’t know French, he doesn’t think much of it, and waves back smiling cheerfully. Levi almost chokes to avoid laughing."
"“You used to tell me I was your hope,” Eren said quietly. “You told me you trusted me, that you’d always trust me.” Levi's jaw clenched. Hadn’t that same thought crossed his mind in the forest? “A lot’s happened since then,” he said instead. For EreriWritingPrompt13: Natsukashii"

"The scowl was pretty much a permanent part of his face now. “Who are you?” This new guy had a disarming smile. Not to be trusted. “I’m your new social worker.” A scoff. Of course. “My third in as many years, this must be a new record.” “Nah, I got you beat.” New guy held up his fingers. “I had four in one.” The scowl remained unimpressed. “So that’s why they sent you? To have some sort of comradery or something?” “Or something.” New guy held out a mangled hand to shake. “You can call me Shiro. Let's get you adopted, Keith.”"
"“What you did what stupid and dangerous, and it scared the hell out of me,” he said. ""I told you to keep going forward with the others, but instead you did the complete opposite."""
"Eren didn't know when dreams of the past started coming to him. He couldn't remember a time when the life he was living was the only life in his head. Armin realized early on that his memories came in two distinct sets, separate from each other but equally valid. He concluded easily that the life he was leading was not his first. Mikasa awoke with a start at age nine to find tears on her cheeks and a picture in her mind, the image of a boy she was sure she had never seen before, but somehow felt indebted to. Something deep in her subconscious was telling her that she had to find this boy, lest something terrible happen to him. Armin once told Eren about a theory he'd read, that people are reincarnated over and over until they learn the lesson they are meant to learn, or serve the purpose they are meant to serve. Eren can't help but think they've missed their chance to do anything of real significance. They'd failed to defeat the titans. What did the universe want from them, if not that?"

"“How did you sleep, darling?” his mother said as she planted a kiss on his forehead and placed a plate of food before him. Levi stared at the food before him, mind quickly side-tracking due to his fatigue. “Fine. It was another memory.” Kuchel gave a weak smile as she stroked her son’s back. Their family had certainly gotten luckier in this life. A life where Levi has his mother, but still lacked a father’s presence. A life where he was considerably taller than in his past life, reaching 4 inches taller than before; still growing. A life where he felt considerably lonely. Was it because of that teal eyed brunette he’s been dreaming about these last few days? Perhaps. Since regaining his memories at the ripe age of 16, Levi has been lifeless as ever, more so than he was originally. The day Eren died was the day Levi became lifeless. Living to survive rather than fulfilling the true meaning of life, for without Eren, life held no meaning at all, at least to Levi it didn't."

He has the biggest hero complex out there, and though it gains him friends he isn’t thought of kindly by the police: they don’t appreciate a scruffy wannabe bohemian trying to do their job. He helps people, and then he vanishes. But when he saves a rather hostile man from being mowed down by an over-enthusiastic bus driver on the streets of Trost, he doesn’t get the reaction he expects. He gets shouted at for helping, for saving, and realises that sometimes people don’t want to be saved, or worse still, don’t think they should be. He also begins to find that no matter how hard he tries, he can't pull himself away from the one person who destroyed his universe... and then put it together again. One thing's for certain: it's going to be a hard pill to swallow."

"That night, he wakes up – he’s not even sure when he managed to fall asleep – with Eren’s mouth a phantom press against his own, and his hands tangled into the sheets instead of Eren’s hair. Lies there and pants, his heart slamming in his chest, and then wipes an arm across his eyes, and rolls out of bed. His knees aren’t quite steady and his face is flushed; and he slides on his slippers and wraps his housecoat tight around himself, and then crosses the room to splash some water on his face. Ends up leaning over the basin with his hands holding tight to the table, doing his best to not look in the mirror, because he really doesn’t like what he sees there. This is horrible. - - - (Now with a gorgeous French translation by alonia. Thank you again. ♥)"

But things don't always turn out as expected, and people aren't always what they seem. “Angel, come here,” he said softly. She jerked her gaze up from his belt and obeyed his command, walking toward him as if in a daze. He placed a hot, open-mouthed kiss on her lips as she stopped in front of him, making her groan as he slid his hands up under her shirt to the smooth skin of her waist. He stroked the rough pads of his thumbs across the tender skin just under her breasts. Then he waited. He knew the wine had loosened her inhibitions, and she would eventually tell him what she wanted if he was patient. And Levi was a very patient man. “Tell me what you’re going to do to me,” she whispered in his ear, sending chills down his spine, making his groin tighten as she ran her tongue along the outer shell of his ear.

But they can heal, they can grow, and leaving their haunted past behind to go to college together seems like the perfect plan, right?

""Love"" is just a beautiful lie. It indeed doesn't exist. This philophobia (the fear of being loved by/ loving someone) thing just makes it more faded. Eren is just another one of those brats that's trying to make it to his heart. Right? Will Eren's so-called love make Levi believe in that four letter word? AU were Eren is the seme and Levi is the uke."
"After complaining to Erwin that Eren wasn't able to train while he was away, they get stuck on the same team on a mission outside the walls. The recon mission goes awry leaving the two men stranded to fend for themselves. They have no 3-D maneuver gear and no way to get help. And the cherry on top of it all? One of them has a broken arm! Then lets throw a little (a lot!) of sleep deprivation into the mix and see what our boys get themselves into."
"Eren keeps on searching for Levi, believing that Levi had gone missing trying to save him. It is only later he realises that no matter how many letters he wrote, how many hours he spent looking for Levi wouldn't bring him back. After the war AU.

"He remembers having to stop himself from instinctively reaching out to touch Eren around people. They never clarified or told anyone what they were becoming, and Armin never felt the need to.

Even now, just considering those things together (Armin; the Colossus; Armin shifting into the Colossus) was enough to make Eren’s own thoughts falter. Two concepts so opposed in his mind that to relate them felt absurd. As often as it had come up in briefings, it had always been discussed in such abstract terms that it was hard to believe Armin had that power, that weapon, sleeping within his skin. (The initial experiments with Armin's Colossus don't go smoothly, but Eren tries his best to soften the blow.)"

Erwin will be forced to decide what is more important to him, the concern he has for Levi or the appearances they are both expected to uphold."
"Mikasa knows she should leave."
"Unfortunately for them both, Levi understood Eren now. Or maybe it wasn’t that. Maybe it was that Eren had been dragged against his will to a place where he and Levi were more similar than Levi would ever want to be to one of his soldiers. Levi thought that was actually more hellish."

"Through the confined expansions of the wood that it's made of, through the grass, the trees, the birds soaring in the skies, they feel each other.

"Niccolo couldn’t explain it. He couldn’t accept his feelings for her at first. They were strong, way stronger than he had ever felt for anyone or anything in his entire life. She was an eldian soldier; risking her life on the daily and making it back before dinner. They could never be together the way he wanted, the way he dreamt about. But he would lay awake at night, the moonlight streaming in through his window and casting light on the empty space in his bed he wished was occupied by her. He felt a dam break in his chest whenever she lit up at the food he presented her, turning away quickly enough she couldn’t catch his face going through the five million stages of love sickness. It was too much. And yet... in the midst of a brewing war, sasha and niccolo find peace (or: sasha and niccolo say goodbye)"

"She is barefoot and her hair is loose, the only thing that she's wearing is a light blue dress, gently moved by the wind that tastes of salt and freedom. But she doesn't feel cold nor warm. The sand is white and thin, so thin the edges of the beach mix with the fog which makes everything unfocused. There is no sun, just light softened thanks to the never-ending clouds, mashed together so you can't really see shapes that move with the wind or any hint of blue under them. It just all looks floaty, placed somewhere in the vast world in which the sea level and the top of the sky meet."
"SPOILERS FOR CHAPTER 138! 13 years after The Rumbling Battle has ended, Gabi looks back at some things that happened from then until now.

"Armin Arlert can’t remember at what point in his life he started hating mirrors, but he can’t help but stare and criticize everything about himself. He knows he is not attractive, so why are the two hottest city men he has ever seen suddenly interested in the small town, plain man he is?"
"Eren says the Sunrise Motel is a shithole , but Zeke doesn’t see it that way at all. He likes the ghost in the walls that flickers the lights to say hi and the rust stains that make the sink look like a crying elephant. Zeke likes his life. He just wishes Eren would smile more.

"In that instant, he wished he had never asked for a little more excitement in his life, he wished he had never been a psychiatrist. He didn't understand why they did it, if it was the thrill of terrifying people or if it was just for the sheer joy of it. You have no idea how pretty and powerful she looks when she does what she loves. I just helped her a little. He' d have to ask officer Levi and professor Hange for help.

She is not like other Marleyans and has never harbored ill will towards Eldians, instead always seeing them as just people.  During Levi's long and intensive recovery, he finds himself enraptured in the fiery doctor and he goes from ready to die on that battlefield to finding that perhaps there are more reasons to live than just fighting. He wonders what fate awaits him the moment he is released from her care and he finds himself dreading that day and unprepared when it comes all too soon. Will Levi find the courage to tell Elena how he feels before he leaves or will he live his life regretting never confessing to the only woman he ever fell in love with?"
"You eased Erwin Smith's head tensions with your voice only to give him a full-blown headache right after, and he can't just let that pass. His concert companion was killed in cold blood. It stained his trench coat. He was interrogated until late midnight. And god, he didn't get his sleep back.

"At twenty years old, Mikasa thinks she’s been through more than most – her mother’s dead because of her, her father is an addict in denial because of her, and now she’s the shadow of the girl she used to be. At twenty years old, Mikasa thinks she’s too young to be starting fresh – but she still moves across the country to leave everything behind in the hopes of forgetting a life that will never be again. At twenty years old, Mikasa can’t understand why in a new city, with no familiar faces, someone already knew who she was, and worse – he seemed to know how she’d gotten that scar on her cheek, too."
"They treat her like the sinless creature she is, rearing her up amongst themselves, the generous men and women of the Corps, instead of trusting the intricacies of childcare with her parents who have been deemed fitful and flighty. (Somewhere in Hange’s office there is a document stating that: custody.)"
"""She’d never have thought, all those weeks ago when she’d first awoken with vomit on the pillows and a night missing from her memory, that she’d be listless and bedridden by the turn of the month."""

"But now, when he touches her, it’s different. There’s something behind it, the innocence and the original intention lost in the way he handles her, pads of his thumbs dragging across soft skin like he knows it better than she does, like he holds something far less virtuous back, straining, longing. She can hear it in his voice, and feel it in his fingertips."

But in what emotional chaos he will still plunge her, she understands only after their shared passionate night."
"As he calls for someone to retrieve the soldier’s corpse, he notices something in the distance. Levi looks harder.

One day, the horse gets encountered by a broken familiar face. They both got something in common: Erwin."
"All I ever wanted to do was do right things I never wanted to be the king, I swear All I ever wanted to do was save your life I never wanted to grab a knife, I swear The Rumbling has come to Eorzea. It falls to the Scions of the Seventh Dawn to protect that which they hold dear yet again, with a little bit of help along the way. For they are not slaves. Nor are they gods. They are just humans."
"How ironic… Leaving her with the means to keep Levi from immediately dying of his injuries only for them to face starvation or exposure."
"Sometimes, all you can do is wait, no matter how much it hurts."
"Levi finds out he's in ""complicated circumstances."" He goes to Erwin with the good, or not so good, news. Warning: spoilers up to chapter 49, inexplicable mpreg."
"Mikasa lives and loves again."
"Historia would die with no regrets. She promised herself that, and she found that as the days passed she prayed more for her goal than for her life itself. Please, she thinks. Let me have a chance at love before it's too late."
"He does realize, as he pulls a now crying Reiner against his chest and whispers apologies and reassurances, that there is some hypocrisy with how angry he is with Reiner for always giving into Eren. Because he’s doing the same thing now. Because he’s told himself time and time again that if Reiner didn’t stop his bullshit, that he’d leave. But here he is pulling Reiner close to him and not even trying to resist when Reiner leans up to kiss him."

"""Don't tell."" Levi whispered with an extent of lewd intention in his tone. Erwin held his breath, knowing his pupils were insanely dilated at that very moment, his heart beat accelerating with the thump, thump, thump of his chest that cried sheer desire for more of Levi's touch. Grey narrowed once again, stalking out the position of the commotion within Erwin, clearly recognising the blonde's abrupt reaction to his movement. ""Someone's excited."" He teased breathily, dangerously close to Erwin's ear, burning crimson in deprivation. . . . . .

"Torn between memories of past and future, Eren Yeager finds himself in an unprecedented situation. The scale of which is important enough to affect everyone connected to him, for good or ill. It is up for him to find and acquire balance, by any means necessary. The survival of most is dependant on it. Eremika centered, with other ships more or less in the background. Kinda AU. Crossposted on fanfiction.net, but the chapters here are more refined and revised."
"He wasn’t sure if this was something she had always wanted or if it was more so to do with lack of options. They had never really talked about it or entertained it. It happened so suddenly, Eren had been gone for a year, and Armin had been talking about ways to find him like he always did."
"Based on season 4 episode 14 the table scene with Mikasa, Armin, and Eren. Featuring: Eren being a jerk and Mikasa trying to cope with being hated by the one she loves. Also I suck at summaries."
"❝ Meeting you is like Armin seeing the ocean for the first time. ❞ * •✰ ❝ What? ❞ you asked, confused. After a moment of silence with only the starry sky as witness, Levi faced you with a small smile on his face. ❝ It means I'm home...

"I dream of you almost every night, this time, I hope I don’t wake up. We will be together soon."
"You did it. You crawled your way out of the Underground and were able to start a new life and a new family as a doctor in Wall Rose. You were happy. So then why? Why did you volunteer to become the Survey Corp’s field medic? Why would you willingly move from one hell to another? And why… was there something so familiar about the military’s most bad-tempered captain? Updates weekly(ish)."
"Reader has anger and communication issues, and can’t deal with confrontation. She also feels sorry for her lack of communication and anger. Eren cheers her up by going on a night drive and taking her to a special spot."

"Mikasa visits Eren's grave."
"""You must return, promise me! Promise, that you will come back to me!"" Not everything went according to the plan when Eren chose to transform instead of leading The Female Titan into the trap. Pressed between five most elite titan killers and a titan shifter, Annie proposed an offer. She couldn't die here, after all. She still had a father to return to."
"Levi stood mounted next to him, eyes trained ahead into the distance. He looked exhausted in a way Eren had never seen him before – pale as death, shoulders slumped like a great weight bore them down. In that moment, he looked the furthest thing from Humanity’s Strongest – his dark lustre had gone, leaving nothing but the worn, tired old man underneath. They rode side by side in silence as the sun sank into the horizon, Eren staring mindlessly at the back of Levi’s head. Eren had taken everything from him. And he felt nothing. (Squad Levi dies. Eren's guilt threatens to drown him.)"
"The sudden burst of volume seemingly disturbing the ambience of the surrounding atmosphere, the celestial sky gradually darkens into a sorrowful grey as the enveloping darkness slowly eats away the once captivating troposphere. The once shining sun disappears from their sights as the aloof complexion of the air significantly escalates by means of the metamorphosed sky. Armin stares wide-eyed at Eren's faraway form as he feels a strong sense of fear overcome him; that escalating fear getting bubbled in with the growing regret of his words... Attack on Titan x Avatar the Last Airbender crossover A continuation of events following the ultimate succession of the Rumbling and termination of the Curse of Ymir.

"She sits by the grassy meadow field on one of those rare sunny days where she made sure her schedule was free. A gentle breeze blows and leaves are sent flying as little clouds of dust surround her. There’s no one else around, and she finds it peaceful as she lays against the old tree, rough bark grazing her back through the silk of her shirt. She pays it no mind as the wind comes to caress her cheeks with its soft touch. It plays with her hair, as short as it was, ruffling it slightly in a messy manner that has her lips turning upwards. One hand tightly clasps around an old brown book, the old coffee-stained papers wrinkling under her fingertip as she lets it fall open on her lap. In her other hand, she holds a feather quill between her fingertips, the end already dipped in black ink. Surrounded by a meadow field of long overgrown green grass, and a tree where the verdant green leaves come to fall gently next to the dirt floor, the words come to her even if she hadn’t intended them to. And so, she begins to write."
"Armin wasn't a person with great aspirations, he never deemed himself worthy of them. Jean disagreed. The potential he saw in the brilliant mind that stood in front of him was unlike anything he'd seen before. He decided to encourage that. He decided to be the push Armin needed to reach the goals he'd only contemplated in his dreams. But what happens when that push tweaks their relationship? Or, Jearmin Steampunk au where Armin is a genius but has low self esteem and trust issues."

"Historia waits for Eren to return to her."
"It began with flowers. The stalking. The obsession. All of it. Set into motion by a deceptively innocent and lovely bouquet of daisies and white lilies. Pure love. Loyal love. A curse disguised as a blessing. Lilies used to be Levi’s favorite. Or One year after Eren kidnaps Levi."
"But when she comes to me , salt catches on his lip and dries sharp on his tongue, a stabbing throb beneath his ribs as he envisions his end, the one he wants but could never have in any way that mattered, so real he can taste the runoff of the mountains and the phantom press of lips he’s never touched. So undeserved, this moment he dreams of, yet his heart longs for it the way his lungs long for air; unrestrained, and selfish. The twisted, unforgivable urge to turn such a grotesque moment into something resembling beauty. Peace, he vies for, in the midst of destruction. A breath of heaven before the flames pull him under for good. I want to see her . He wants to marry her."
"Levi decides to take his own life an october afternoon He does not count on relearning how to live, nor finding reasons to keep going"
"""I loved her so much, I can't even begin to describe it. Which is why it broke me to watch her die in my arms."" After Mikasa's death, Eren isn't sure what to do with himself. He feels responsible, as if he killed Mikasa. Armin feels a different kind of guilt. See, his feelings for Eren put him in a difficult position. It's not very respectful to steal a dead girl's boyfriend. Through Eren's guilt and Armin's shame, can they find love?"

"""Take this as a warning, Captain."" the man spat the last word and walked away from him, his henchmen following like dogs. ""Go back to the Underground!"" Levi growled through gritted teeth, too weak to get up. ""Don't worry, Levi."", the man opened the door and didn't even turn to him, ""If I go back, you'll go with me."" ------------------------------------------------------ Levi thought he had his past tucked away neatly in the back of his head for no one and not even himself to see, but when people from the Underground suddenly appear inside the military things are getting more dangerous than he assumed."
"Her number is still stored in his phone. Modern AU."
"Erwin nodded, “Sure thing… I’ll see you next week?” Levi nodded, shooting Erwin a small smile, “Yeah. I look forward to it.” Erwin could feel his heart racing - I look forward to it. That had to mean something, didn’t it? Levi wouldn’t just say that if he didn’t feel something towards Erwin - if they didn’t have some sort of reciprocating feelings between them. But Erwin was a little too scared to test the waters right now, so he simply discarded the condom and pulled his uniform back on. “I’ll see you then,” Levi waved, sitting down on the bed and watching Erwin wave back before he left."

Back then they’d been so excited and happy to look forward to the future. Things were different now than they were back then. (Day one for Reibert Week 2022! Prompt is gender swap)"

However, resisting the pull of the young man becomes harder and harder as someone starts to leave flowers in his window. Written for Day Two of 'Save The Date' following the [Flowers] & [Soulmate AU] prompts. ""There was a small sad smile on his face as he brought the plant inside and sat it down on his desk. ‘ Some poor girl will never learn how much they’re loved. ’ White carnations meant gratitude and pure love after all. Nevertheless, he was going to take good care of the plant. He just hoped the mysterious lover boy will find the right window next time because he really didn’t want to be woken up again unnecessarily.

"You’ll marry me under the canopy of green belonging to the tree you climbed as a child, longing to touch the sky. I’ll bury you beneath that tree, roots breaking through earth, where I fell in love with your smile, and you in love with mine. I shall not weep, for even your ghost could not relinquish my heart, which you gave to me on bended knee at the trunk of that tree, a lifetime ago."
"After a heated argument with Eren, Mikasa storms off and Armin comes to comfort her; but he may have made things worse, only Ymir can save them, and how did  Sasha get brought into this again?"

"Armin was new in town and living with his Opa, a man he’d never really met before except for in a few brief moments in his childhood. He was in a foreign city and felt so, so isolated. That is, until he found a mailbox that allowed you to be penpals with kids in the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, and he got a letter back from one Eren Jaeger. Told through a collage of memories, letters, and glimpses of the present, Armin tries to piece together the exact path that led to where he is now, living on a peaceful, quiet farmland in Germany with the former inmate, and whether or not he regrets anything."
"He was running out of time, everyone knew that. And what Eren Yeager regretted the most out of all his poor decisions within his lifetime, was that he never told Mikasa Ackerman how he really felt. During his time in solitude, he has all the time in the world to think this over. Especially when there's a recollection of memories shared between Eren and Mikasa looking back at the time he lost and what he could’ve had."
"Thank Goddess, the guy is alive. He has several injuries all over his body but he’s alive, though unconscious. The man puts him in one of the many bedrooms on the second floor. He cleans the wounds along his body, taking longer in the face. It’s like forgetting the words of your favorite song. So familiar and so strange at the same time. Suddenly, the guy opens his eyes. That green. That sight. It punches him in the chest, his breath fails. A whisper leaves the injured lips: ‘brother’, and he shuts unconscious again. Zeke can’t remember the name. Neither the ‘where’ nor the ‘when’. But he knows the guy. Deep in his heart, he knows. Multiverse AU in which the titans are quite different, Eren gets pregnant, and they suffer over and over and then die."
"She’s not in her crystal anymore, she’d remind him. She’s out now. She’s here and he can no longer keep her out of harm’s way. And she’d be right. * * * * He's the ambassador now and she's the ambassador's... secretary? No, that's not right. That's his bodyguard. His trusted right hand. Also inaccurate. Annie is... What is she to him?"
"Armin knows now that the world is cold, cruel and merciless. It was never meant to be a garden bed, only a prison. And yet in the shadows of the stone walls, there are little roses growing in the cracks, waiting to be counted and loved."
"His eye tingled with threatening tears and he doesn't know if it was from the horrid smell of the dead titans around him or from the faces appearing in the smoke before him."
"“Petra was bringing up the rear, and her fear turned to horror as she watched Levi’s horse take off, riderless, inadvertently kicking him in the chest, and then upside the head as her powerful hind hooves left the ground. His body was thrown back, his head hit a tree, and he did not rise. “Captain!” Petra cried and turned her horse away from the jump, hastily dismounting and dashing to his aid. “Petra, no!” Eld cried as he looked back at the scene. The squad couldn’t stop, couldn’t go back for fallen soldiers. Even if the soldier was Captain Levi. There was red smoke behind them, another titan that couldn’t be more than half a mile away. In addition, Petra’s horse, anxious as it watched the herd begin to leave, jumped the ditch, leaving the wounded pair stranded.” Levi gets hurt outside the walls."

"Little peeks into Armin and Annie's relationship. As familiars, significant others, and everything in-between."
"Armin's head pounded, in one hand he was so angry that he wanted to burn everything in his path, wanted to punch Eren for always having something smart to say, and for never liking Annie to begin with. He wanted to go back and find Historia and tell her she had no right to be answering any phone calls of his and not even letting him know, he wanted to tell Annie to go away and leave him alone once and for all, and on the other hand everything made so much sense now.

"Being a member of the 104th cadet corps is not without the usual teenage anguish and heart break. Annie finds that her mind has been infiltrated by Armin Arlert, and so has Mina Carolina’s. Meanwhile, Armin wants to find a way to closer to Annie, no matter what it might take for him… The story of young hearts caught in a web of jealousy."

"“Need to blow some steam off?” “Possibly,” murmurs Eren, not bothering to sound convinced, finding himself desperate for the smell of dried sweat on Reiner’s skin. “So?” A soft, harmless snort. “You’re not supposed to ask.”"
"""..And make sure ya put up a bit of a fight. Ya lay down and spread yer legs for 'em right away, he's gonna get suspicious."" --- In a society where omegas are rare and viewed as nothing more than playthings, Levi Ackerman works to escape a fate of being sold off to the highest bidder. He does this by taking unconventional assassination jobs from his uncle, under the guise of a gift. What happens when one of his targets sees right through his ruse and he is now owned by one of the smartest and strangest alphas he's ever met; a man by the name of Erwin Smith."
"West Germany, Sixties: Although Levi has made it from Dresden to the West, he is incredibly disillusioned with how little life offers him there, as well. When a mysterious man makes him an unbeatable offer, he decides to jump at the chance and supports him in the reopening of an old café, used as a money-laundering device to cover their lucrative deals with the black market in the East. From now on, Levi is Erwin's right hand in business ─ and perhaps his ally in fighting the inexorable. Torn between mistrust and the desire for affection, Levi begins to learn more and more about his partner and the meaning of life."
"Eren and Armin have a fight it gets visical. And then they fell the fells"
"Erwin held tightly to Levi’s hand as the poor man laid in the grass, blood pooling everywhere below him. He could see the horrible bite Levi had suffered in his stomach, the guts that were spilling out of him as his breathing became heavier and heavier. Levi let out a quiet sob, looking up at Erwin with something like desperation in his eyes. Erwin had tears rolling down his face. He didn’t know what the fuck to do. He and Levi had been  traversing the zombie apocalypse for months now together, and a hoard of zombies had just attacked their camper. Erwin was able to fight off the zombies, but Levi had gotten bit, and Erwin had fought off the last of the zombies, shooting them in the head while Levi lay on the ground bleeding out."
"Erwin and Levi have been through their own wars and battles. Leaving one physically scarred, and both mentally damaged. Healing is hard, and for Erwin, his world seems nothing but stagnant and seamless. Levi has never known how  to communicate using words and would rather sit alone in silence. But they can learn how to take the baby steps together."
"Armin can't sleep while he's reeling from the side effects of his new Titan inheritance. Before he could wrestle with it further, Mikasa pays him a visit."
"Just a little eren excerpt that I wrote for myself and wanted to share here as well. This is basically an eren character study (?) if that’s what you would call it. Includes depictions of carla’s death, chapter 131, the rumbling, and eren’s internal thoughts/feelings."

"Levi is struggling with his mental health and is in the midst of a breakdown. With his own thoughts telling him to leave and his heart telling him to stay, he can't help but confront Erwin about the 'truth' when it comes to what he believes the next step in their relationship is. Putting Erwin first no matter how much it will break him is Levi's priority, after all you'll do anything for the one you love...Won't you?"
"Marco's just lucky his career didn't end before it even got started, but as he's climbed the ranks of the medical team, he can't help but wonder if being surrounded by all this death is worth the effort of his survival. AU where Marco survived, but can't remember why."

"Eren’s had a hard life, but even monsters can change I feel a deep emotional connection to eren. Vent posts"
"There was no point. There was nothing left to live for. Nothing to give a damn about. No one waiting on him for when he got out, especially since he'd be in a pine box. Well, maybe Hanji would be there. She still visited him, her and Mike and Nanaba and Erwin. Probably because they knew why he'd done it, why he'd said ""fuck you"" to the law and thrown himself into a veritable suicide mission. And they still loved him, even if he was a murderer, even if Levi was no longer there."
"When Erwin and Hange had dared Levi to be nice to Eren for a week, he certainly hadn't expected half of his comrades to suddenly start thinking they were dating. There are a lot of people complaining (Namely, Eren and Levi.) ------ A fic in which I slander Ereri (with plot!!) because it is a pedophilic excuse of a ship and I despise all of its enjoyers."
"When Porco’s death finally catches up to her, the grief is as strong as her love for him. A eulogy to the love that has nowhere to go."
"He hated him the first time he met him. But why is it after all this time, it hurts just to look at his peaceful face on that roof?"
"""Scars were lines, just simple marks on the body. Or so, that was what her eyes convinced her to see. And at that moment, she was desperate to believe it, even when her hazy reality was telling her something else."" Hange survives the war but loses too much of herself and Levi is there to pick her back up."
"An exhausted and curious queen and knight on her day off head to town, that's how it all started.

Takes place 1 year after the fall of Wall Maria. Levi and OC are both 25."
"""I should warn you, Captain,"" he says. His eyes darken. Erwin glances down at his hands on the rich wood of his sculpted desk; pale, slender things. The skin is swollen and broken on three of his knuckles. He glances back at him. ""I will never trust someone like you. You can squirm and dance, use your pretty words and your pretty voice all you want. I won't buy any of your bullshit. And you will never really have me."" Erwin nods calmly. ""Sounds like a challenge to me."" A few months after Levi is recruited into the Corps, his relationship with Erwin changes him forever."
"This is a collection of chapters related to the fic Protect and Serve that weren't part of the main storyline. There are different POVs, backstories, and a variety of other things related to the original story: Eren Jaeger has a secret, one that is tearing him apart. Alcohol is the only thing that is holding him together, and it is breaking him in an entirely different way. When he meets Levi, he feels that he has maybe found someone who can help piece him back together. The problem is that Eren is certain Levi will abandon him as soon as he learns the source of Eren's poisonous shame. Jean Kirschtein has been a police officer for years. He's trained several recruits, but there is something different about Marco Bodt. He begins to have strange feelings toward his new partner, feelings that he is ruthlessly ashamed of. One night after a few too many drinks things get a little out of hand and Jean can't even look at Marco. He has no idea how he's supposed to continue working with him."
"When Eren loses his mother to a vampire attack, he dedicates his life and soul to find the monster that killed her, hell bent on taking him out even if it kills him. Joining Erwin's little group of hunters was never a part of the plan, nor was falling for Levi of all people."
"There will always be someone that will care until the end."
"Erwin learns to love how Levi wants him."

"AU. Levi hates the song, not because it's poorly written, not because it's sappy and moronic, not because the beat sucks, but because it led to a disastrous one night stand with Eren that leaves the both of them broken and angry."
"Levi loves Erwin's hands."
"After getting fired from her job, 17-year-old Ymir has no choice but to go back to school and move to the dorms. She has to share her everyday life with three other teenagers - including a certain Krista, whose fake smile intrigues her greatly. Before she knows it, she gets caught in one question: ""What's behind it?"". Yumikuri. Possibly triggering."

On a expedition Levi is gravely injured and perishes. Eren is finally pushed over the edge by his death.

"He kisses his mouth, his hands, his hair like he doesn’t need to breath. They’re sensations from a life ago and don’t always make sense."
"She knew there was more to him, more for him to show her now that they were married, although no one knew, even after the few glimpses of Erwin’s weakness he had offered to her in the late hours of the night. She would find it, push him to the very limits until he cracked under the weight of his shield, bursting open for her, and she would accept each tiny piece of shrapnel that would impale her, burn at her skin. But it will hurt, burn like fire and weigh like lead over her shoulders, but how it will hurt will still be her challenge to find out, one that she feels she is following with more reckless abandon than her better judgment."
"Life has always been a ready challenger for the two of them, one that they've fought tooth and nail against to find peace of mind. So when it decides to pose another trial for the start of their family, they have no choice but resort to measures that most might think would be the simplest path. But nothing has been simple for Hange and Levi, and what may be the easiest for some may threaten to turn their life upside down, and unintentionally redefine the assumptions life holds to raising a family."
"Based on the Attack on Titan setting, integrated with elements and characters of Tokyo Ghoul, the story follows the leads of Eren and Kaneki who are facing the reality of this environment, and the consequences that come with it.

"With the titans defeated and the world slowly coming to normality, Jean Kirstein is forced to start adjusting to a life without walls."
"At twenty-five years old, they meet again."
"Each night, Levi Ackerman writes a story for the end of the world. He writes of men and women who are hollowed out, dreams rotting and decaying until their bodies are nothing and their souls plummet into the earth. It is inevitable, he thinks, not morbid. It is 1938 and the world is ending."
"What do a pair of wings represent? There are many meanings, different ones for each person. Freedom perhaps? Do they both stand for two lovers, each one processing a wing? Maybe they each represent helping hands. Each with another person to say that they will help each other on the other’s journeys and when they are together, the pair will forever be together no matter where the other is. These are just a few meanings. I don’t know the true answer. No one does. Like I said, there are different meanings for each person. But the one thing they all have in common is that they are all correct."
"Eren Jaeger is a  popular 15 year old model training two up and coming models. Erwin Smith and Levi Ackerman. How will Eren deal with his developing feelings for the younger boy?

"Marco was in the top ten, and you, the reader, haven't even managed to get to the top twenty. So how is it that only you survived? At least for the time being..."
"It took a second to process, so unexpected was the sight. Despite the names he liked to tease her with: “clumsy giant” and “shit-for-vision”, in action, Hanji was as quick and graceful as they came. Shaken free, the steel grappling cable snaked past, whipping at the air. Beneath it, Hanji fell. Head knocked back and arms dangling loose at her sides, she dropped, unconscious. He didn’t think. Instincts honed sharper than a knife’s edge commanded his limbs to move. Release. Pivot. Dive."

"“What, kid? I need to take a shit.” Levi’s mouth was curled into a small half smile that meant he wasn’t nearly as annoyed by the interruption as he seemed. But Levi blinked as he fully turned to face Eren, mouth falling from that attractive half smile as Levi instead bit his bottom lip, looking Eren from top to bottom. PERMANENT HIATUS"

"Falling in love wasn't part of Erwin's plans and would destroy them if he let it."
"Eren Jäger, 22 and a kid in his hands, didn't exactly plan to become a parent. He doesn't usually plan at all. Maybe that's why he moved and left everything he knew behind. Now, still, without a plan he tries to figure out how to do this thing adults call parenthood and tries to find his way. He doesn't really know what he's looking for or what he wants, but he's damn determined to make his life work. After all he has two lives to take care of now: baby Carla and himself.

"“Nothing. It’s just… you have a beautiful smile, sir”, the boy silently stated and stuck his small brush into dark green paint, slowly and provocatively stroking the canvas in front of him, his eyes being at a steady position, refusing to move in any direction other than the green that was being smeared onto his painting. The older man refused to look anywhere but at the man that had a golden key hanging around his neck. Levi’s heart skipped a beat. “Do I know you”, he meant to ask, but it came out as a statement. He could see the young man flinch while painting, his hand freezing in place."
"The creaking of the floorboards and the walls. He hears them-- shuffling of the feet, whispers of the dead, through the halls, in his head. They go on like that for days, weeks, months.

I merely observed the way natural selection selected its course, because every single being was a monster. There was no one worth saving... at least that was what I thought until I met a pair of silver eyes. Or the story (because I know my summary sucks) where Eren looks like a 15 year old but is actually ancient as fuck. He finds one specific human interesting (aka Levi), so he watches over him like a goddamn stalker (not really). Eventually said human becomes his natural enemy, but Eren will still do anything for him. Because Eren knows that he can kick Levi's ass any day."
"Loving Levi was like trying to catch smoke."

"(if this fic had a cover, it would be Levi dressed as Fabio clutching a swooning Eren, probs) In the Kingdom of Mitras, there exist two classes: the ruling and the serving.

When the new queen picks loud, brash Eren to form the bond with, the young man imagines his world coming to a proverbial end — along with his autonomy. Literally. The bond gives Eren’s “master” total control over his actions. Once Eren’s bond with the rightful ruler is completed, though, it comes as a surprise to the entire kingdom when the person he is bound to is not actually the queen… Now Eren must navigate not only a kingdom thrown into chaos and now threatened by war, but a loveless relationship he has no true say in, as well as new friends and enemies, all while trying to find a way to break the bond and return home to his ailing mother. Even Eren, with his fighter’s spirit, knows he’s got his work cut out for him. If only his new husband weren't so damn good looking."

He remembers when Eren got accepted into Trost U and helping him move into the dorms. He remembers long nights in his one bedroom studio apartment in Maria. He remembers Eren promising him he'd be back from Rose and visiting his family before his birthday.

"Armin has learnt what his lover is. Yet they kiss."
"- The sadness and greif he felt as he peered into the glowing eyes of the other across from him matched the fear of them disappearing in his gut. His face remained as passive as ever, but emotion boiled over internally to the point of rising acidic bile in his throat as he leaned forward and rested his head against the cold slab of the desk. “Sleep.

"""Same shit, different year."" Annie told herself, walking into the doors of the school building. She couldn't have been more wrong. Mikasa thought she had life figured out. She failed to realize though, that she had never figured herself out. Friendships are made, and left. Secrets are formed, and kisses stolen. Fights break out, schemes are laid, and clothes are shed. Annie expected chaos, what she didn't expect was to find solace in the coldest eyes around. ----- Or alternatively - Annie is dense, Mikasa’s falling in love, and detective Armin is on the case. Or he would be, if Eren would stop trying to find the fucking bubble sherlock pipe and hurried up already! ----- Read notes, man. Important."

I **am** still working on this fic, however, I have no idea how long it is going to be before I am able to get a new chapter uploaded. Sorry 32-year-old Levi Ackerman doesn't realise just how bored he really is. Jaded, stuck in a routine of work, gym, clean, oblivion and bordering on clinically depressed, to say things are a bit shitty is an understatement. 24-year-old Eren Jaeger has a problem. Fired from his job as an English Teacher after assaulting a student's father (the guy was an asshole), he just about manages to avoid jail time thanks to his lawyer (and ex-lover, also an asshole), and now he has to spend the next six months in anger management classes with some pacifist asshole looking down on him and showing him how to ""cope with things"". When Levi's asshole cat knocks a bottle of his best scotch from the roof of his apartment block, almost killing one unsuspecting Eren Jaeger, neither man realises how much of an impact it will have on both of their lives."

He's on a constant rotation of different therapies and is finally forced into a pain management group; he's been to pain management before but it was 1:1. Jean doesn't really like people too much. He's grouchy and hard to talk to as his pain slowly worsens, making it harder to really take care of himself.

"""Am I really worth something to you?"" Armin nodded quietly at the question. It was true. Erwin was… ridiculously handsome. He was strong, he was tall… but it was more than that. He cared so deeply. He would barely show it, but Armin had spent so much time working with him.

"Humanity has been beset by monsters known as Titans for a hundred years.

"A complete ""what-if"" retelling of Attack on Titan from the beginning if Ymir and Historia were the main characters. Starts with a rewrite of Harsh Mistress of the City spin-off light novel and continues from there.

Where there are uglier things than Titans gnawing at the roots of the world. With them the sun falls and the sky soon follows. Sanctuary is breached, and in its rapture is the grim reminder that they are cattle herded into a cage. The year is 845.

"A split second filled with the worst possible things that could go wrong during an expedition costs Levi his memories, and Erwin his lover."
"On that day, a part of humanity remembered the dread that was a life under the rule of tyrants… The humiliation of being trapped like birds… like beings that aren’t humans. Sealed by 'real' humans and forced to live on a remote island surrounded by a wall and incapable of escaping, the monsters were forced to berate each other in order to survive. Their differences had been amplified, and a huge distance had been put between Alphas, betas and omegas, with Alphas being the ones to rule, betas having to work their whole lives, and the omegas being treated like the garbage they've been taught to think they are. However, amongst those small, humiliated creatures, there was one who stood out in particular; one that decided to go against all of that, only to be hunted down, forced to bond, but escape, then hunted down again and then seek sanctuary in a common beta. And whilst Levi and Eren fight for freedom, everyone else fights for survival."
"Always. Always, always, always, as long as Armin had known Jean and Eren, they've been fighting. Why? Always fighting for no reason. It was stupid. Jean was starting to think so too. Why did they keep doing it? Armin finally realizes the reason."
"For nearly a decade, Eren had only ever experienced isolation and pain. Living on his own, he becomes accustomed to the meager life he'd managed to scrape by with, convinced that was all he'd ever make of himself. Originally he was content with this, but slowly he begins to feel the burn of a flame long forgotten begin to spike once more. Will he finally breach his shell of comfort and find enjoyment in life, or will he succumb to circumstance and allow the rekindled flame to die once more? NOTE: For anyone wondering, Levi makes his debut in chapter 13, however I would highly recommend you read the entire fic so that you have some context on how Eren has ended up at the point he's at in that specific chapter. Thanks for reading."

Mikasa Ackerman is a gorgeous Omega who he's going to win over and bring home to his mother. Except, no.

"Levi was 8 years old when his mother got a new job and moved them to a small two bedroom basement apartment on the nicer side of town. The change was a little overwhelming, that was until he met the boy with the big ocean eyes that lived upstairs. Maybe life wouldn't be so bad after all..."

A world in which titanic-sized monster-people roam the earth; where he has close friends, enemies, lovers; in which there are some mindblowing, eerie, and frustratingly out-of-reach circumstances; in which people get murdered, commit suicide, or simply... go missing.

This is the part of the series ""Attack on Dangan"" in which all characters are rooted up from the Dangan Ronpa/SDR2 story line, and put in the Attack on Titan universe, as if they had lived there their whole lives."
"Jean has a habit of falling for people too easily and Eren, not enough."
"Levi wasn't sure how long he'd been asleep when he was torn from the endless darkness of his mind by a deep, disturbing groan. Eren's body jerked roughly, his nails digging painfully into Levi's upper arm. Levi was disoriented for a moment as he sat up, unsure of what was happening.

"Marco wakes up three months before the Attack on Trost and tries to change the course of history. Marco knows there are two possibilities: first – he's somehow gone back in time and Reiner, Bertholdt and probably Annie are titans, and second – he's gone insane. He's inclined to believe the latter, but he remembers all too clearly the feeling of Reiner's hand covering his mouth, he remembers Annie taking off his gear, he remembers the titan's teeth. There isn't a night he doesn't dream of those teeth."
"Levi is not like the others, but that's okay, because so are you. Expected to present as an alpha, you grow up with the boy that is expected to present as an omega, but life is not fair and problems arise oh so very easily. But you're both not what your parents thought you to be, and the tension between the two of you is easily ignored in favour of an relationship that has an end tied to a clock that is ticking down. Because alphas don't waste their times with betas after they meet their omega bondmates. It's an unspoken rule as old as the first tales."
"Historia had never meant to tell Ymir her birthday."
"Such thoughts are always in his mind, as it never seems to get rid of her. The walk he's taking in the corridors has been long, his candle is at the point of extinction, but he doesn't care. He doesn't even know why he's doing this to himself; walking up and down the corridors of the abandoned headquarters, so he can watch over her. To listen to her voice."
"Eren is clinically depressed: he had been abused by his father as a child after his mother had passed away. He had no one to turn to in regards to family, and instead chose to run away, abandoning his friends and cutting bonds with his father. Fast forward to today, where he’s being taken care of by his friend, Armin, and has never recovered from all those years of scars inflicted onto him physically and engraved into his mind mentally. It’s up to him to seek help from a therapist. And he does, from a certain Dr Levi Ackerman."

"Rayne Lee was sent on a mission. As the Wolf Titan, she was sent by Marley, along with the Armored, Colossal, Jaw, and Female Titans to find and extract a descendant of the Royal Family Reiss. With a Royal in their grasp, Marley would be able to regain control of all lost Titan Powers, strengthing their hold over the world. They would also have an unlimited army of controllable Titans to unleash upon their enemies. Rayne Lee, however, was a true loyal Eldian, like her father and his father before. She also had another mission, a mission given to her by the Founding Titan herself, a mission given in fear and desperation in the final moments of life. A mission to restore Marley's kingdom to its former glory. Rayne Lee, along with other members of the Royal Guard she meets along the way, will make it their life's mission to find their Queen, their comrades, and set all of the Eldian people free from the disgusting, deplorable regime of the Fake King Fritz. For as every Eldian knows, the Founding Titan will always lead her people home, to peace, to freedom."
"!!HEAVY EDITING!! Levi had accepted his fate: Dying without his soulmate, being a failure in the eyes of society, and never visiting the star he was made of. At least, that's what he thought.

"A lonely author who has lost his creativity meets a man that bring his world alive."
"I could ignore the thoughts that had been eating at the back of my mind for years. It was easy. I would see a boy who I thought was pretty and say, 'yeah, but he's not as pretty as that girl over there'. It was a lie, the boy was always more attractive. But I could lie to myself forever. That's all an Ackerman was good for, anyways, according to my Uncle. Lying and fighting. Then he came into my life. The type of man ballads are written about. Bright mismatched eyes and messy brown hair, a smile that wormed its way into the coldest of hearts. I was screwed. I was head over heels for this boy with big dreams and bright eyes."

"Then the overwhelming scent of pain hit him, an omega in pain, and he almost dropped to his knees to scurry closer and beg them to let him help. He fought the urge down but couldn't avert his eyes. He realized he must have stood staring for a while as the person's head lolled back, eyes closed, and they heaved out a sigh. ""Move on, Alpha. I don't need help."""
"There's never a good night in this place. It's usually always the same. The people may seem different on the outside, but deep down they're the same disgusting monsters, like it's embedded in their bones. My routine: think about it, get fucked, think about it, get paid, think about it, wash up, think about it, get fucked. I'm just as vile as the people I'm with. I'm no good. I'm no angel. I'm just a normal, awful, person. STATUS: Hiatus. (Might be dropped)"
"Armin is weightless flight of loyalty, tenderness, light. Eren is a pure drive of energy, brightness, innocence. First is the standard of elegance, second - of courage. And one day the elegance will bend to the courage, will allow it to break the wings, will humbly shut up in tightening bonds. AU in which Eren changes the nature of Armin."
"For months Erwin allowed himself to truly care for someone, opening himself up to the very real possibility of an unhealable heartbreak from a swift, untimely death.  And Levi thinks it’s a game."
"“W-what are you doing here?” Levi eyed him up and down, with what felt like the most judgmental stare he’d ever received, before non-chalantly waving his hand. “Isn’t it obvious?” He asked. Eren shook his head. He had no idea what the hell was going on. Which was pretty normal for him actually—but today, it just felt like one big, cruel, joke. “I’m here to coach you Jaeger—or better yet, I’m here to help you win a gold medal in next year’s Grand Prix Final.” Or basically, the AOT/YOI crossover I desperately need"

Imagine him how you'd like. If you'd like me to find a description of him, please let me know and I will be glad to do so. Trigger Warning!"
"Eren Jaeger had spent the last two weeks tending and nursing a huge fucking crush, and Levi had been the one stupid enough to plant the seed in whatever hormonal abscess passed for a teenaged heart."
"Eren was a normal kid with a normal childhood, a sick mother, and a father he never really knew. He had his goals set and was attending a well-known law school when his life suddenly turned upside down. His father had apparently researched illegal things no one ever bothered to explain before he had been found dead in his own laboratory and without the supposed experiments. So Eren had to return. His life that had been harsh, but perfect, was falling apart once he got home, going from a highly-ranked law student to a mere guy with multiple jobs to bring food to the table and having to take care for his mother whose health was deteriorating. Ever since then, things were... normal. Plain. One year later, when Eren thought it was finally over, a group of people decided to turn up in the coffee shop he worked at. And one raven-haired detective thought it would be a good idea to hire him to be his assistent in the search of the very crime Eren had tried to forget. And Eren, feeling wrapped around his little finger, couldn't really say 'no'."

"The first time I met you, you were laughing. And after that first time, it was a rare occasion you couldn’t find something to laugh about, no matter the circumstances. You were the one holding all of us up, finding those silver linings in everything, the jokes in even the most dire of situations. I was so busy shaking my head, calling you crazy while I hid my own grins, I didn’t realize there was no one holding you up. The ones who laugh the loudest are the ones in the most pain or so they say. I never was a very good listener."
"Time has stopped for Levi, life ceased to move completely. He's been stuck in a moment ever since the tragic night. Frozen. And then one day, his eyes meet bright green and his world starts anew. His heart gets a sudden jolt and time begins to move once again. But does Levi remember what it means to truly live or is it too late to melt his cold heart? Is it frozen? Or maybe it's broken beyond hope?"
"Your two best friends are precious to you in ways that you had never imagined yourself capable of feeling. They look at you in the way that everyone wants to be looked at. In this ruined world, it is dangerous to have even one special person. You just happen to find two. This is your story."

"Marco wakes up in the forest of giant trees, not knowing how he got there. After making the grim discovery that he has been reincarnated into a titan, he wanders aimlessly around the forest until he stumbles across a stranded Jean, about to meet his fate with a titan ready to devour him.

But both boys have a past, and what beguins as a usual encounter develops in something much deeper, something that may heal wounds or spread salt on them.

"It was the biggest decision Levi had to make. (Written for Eruri Week Day 1: Titanwin)"
"""Is it ever not just like that?"" Jean asked. His voice was rye and hard. It made Armin flinch. ""You pull a trigger, Armin. You press a fucking button. You don't even need to be touching them.

All I cared about was her, my hands lifting of their own accord to tangle in her black hair. But then a flash of gold eyes and an all too familiar devilish smile flashes across my mind, instantly causing me to pull back as if I had been burnt. Mikasa stares at me, her eyebrows furrowed. She looks both content with our kiss and yet hurt that I had snatched myself from her, and I didn't know what to say to ease her mind. I definitely couldn't say that I had been thinking of Reiner of all people when I pulled away... Why...did life have to be so hard."

"Erwin is the flashiest man Levi’s ever met. It annoys the shit out of him. In Erwin’s defense, it technically isn’t his fault that he’s a handsome son of a bitch. What is his fault, however, is how he knows he looks like Greek god, and uses it to his advantage. His slicked-back blond hair, suave jokes, and winning smile make all the ladies swoon. Levi only knows because they make him swoon too, although he'd rather choke to death before admitting that. So yeah, it annoys the shit out of Levi. It doesn’t help that they’re best friends slash roommates, and Levi has to idly sit by the sidelines as Erwin goes through woman after woman."

"I couldn’t tell you how it started. I’ve gone over it so many times in my head and I assume the best place to start is the beginning. I was twenty-three, and late for work. Something I never was, was late. People could say a lot about me, that I am short (I dare you to say that one to my face), that I am cold, that I am an asshole, that I am quick to anger, that I am fucking OCD as hell, but one thing nobody could call me is late. For some reason that day though, I was and it changed my life forever."

"“It’s a curse specific to the god of destruction,” Zeke said, leaning forward in his chair, “and, if you’re not careful, it will kill you before your thirteen years are up.” Armin felt like he couldn’t breathe—whether it was from the shock of having even less time to live than he previously thought or from the cluster of flowers clogging up his throat, he didn’t know. He rubbed his neck absentmindedly, as if he could force the blockage out eventually.

Erwin Smith, one of the most highly acclaimed generals of the Nazi Army, is highly aware of this fact. He’s also highly aware that blackmailing a French general into serving underneath him, hiding a Jewish prisoner in a secret room of his home, and adopting three children—one of which shouldn’t technically be alive—is likely to get him executed on the spot. Then again, Erwin’s never been one to show his emotions, so whether or not his situation frightens him in the least is a different question altogether."

What if I already am? --- Captain Levi Ackerman was a man who nobody wanted to cross, and he was feared by nearly everybody—everybody except Petra Ral. Petra Ral, a young woman with a radiant smile and ivory skin, was unlike others in the best ways possible—most notably her close bond with Captain Levi Ackerman, a bond going farther than that of a mere captain and his subordinate. They had a story-book romance desired by everyone, but nobody dared say that not every story has a happy ending. --- Author's Note: This story is NOT abandoned, I just have writer's block and no inspiration, but it isn't over and I WILL get back to it eventually"

"Eren probably should have thought about the fact that he's a terrible dancer before agreeing to dance with Mikasa at her wedding in place of their deceased father.

Unluckily, Eren can't stop blushing long enough to actually learn how to not step on his dancing partner's feet. --- Eren also had been harboring a huge crush on the man for three years, but he had learned to treat it as one of those unfortunate things in life that you have no control over.

"I took a look behind me to see my house one last time before I fell.

After that we would spend a day taking out the plain glass windows and putting in the new beautiful windows. I felt tears gathering at the corners of my eyes as something hit me.

""I thought they hated each other"" Before losing hope he thinks that maybe... if he tells Mikasa who the captain really is... he might have a chance, or fuck it up?

But, in the end, he was happy. Little Eren Yeager just did not know how much he would long for those days - even the bad ones, after a fatidical night where he turned into a monster. And he learned to live with his new titanic body, regulating his strength and being careful with his movements so he wouldn't hurt anybody, because he would not let himself turn even more into the monster he had became. But he simply was a naive kid and he chose to ignore what was soon to come. Of course his family wouldn't be able to keep him a secret forever; someone would discover it soon enough. And so, the nine-year-old had to face what was to come, now, all by himself. He wouldn't have a father to guide him and remember him how strong he was and how careful he needed to be. He wouldn't have his friends to lift his mood when he was in a bad day or when he was feeling lonely. And he also wouldn't have his mother to hug when he felt desperate and like he couldn't do it anymore. He was, truly, alone."

"“HEY!” the soldier yelled as he swung himself as close as possible. With a growl the titan turned towards Gavin, ice-blue irises focusing on the human in front of him who barely had the size of his hand. The sight still made the soldier step back a little with weak knees, even after months of getting used to Nines’ titan form.

But all of that is taken from him when Kamski demands the best of the best for 'project shifter', working with the few people that can turn into a titan. He finds himself in front of one of these giants, even taller than the others, and quickly learns that the ice-eyed titan doesn't have himself under control. And Gavin seems to be the only one that can calm the beast raging inside the shifter."

There, she will be pushed to the limits, always under the apathetic controlling scrutinizing eyes of Captain Levi. Who finds her to be nothing more than a nuisance and a waste of time to even serve a purpose to humanity.

He was on the edge of the actual hut, his legs stretched in front of him. He felt his cheeks heating as he looked at the older man. “I think I do…” “We should get some rest.” Mikasa outstretched the blanket and laid back. “I tried to make our bags into pillows but they’ll be bumpy-“ “I think I’m going to go talk to him.” Eren whispered. “If he kills me there will be witnesses-“ Mikasa studied him, nodding. “If it makes you happy.

"Because ordinary meant a pen in his hand and his head in the other, paperwork slowly worked through as time bled by. It meant periods of silence that served as a reminder as to how fleeting amity could be, the lack of noise almost taunting in his office. It meant crisp sheets and neatly-arranged pillows, not because he insisted on doing his bed every morning (although it wouldn’t be entirely out of his character to do so), but because he simply never used it. Ordinary always meant his bed felt too big, too cold, too empty when he was alone. But never before had ordinary meant laying beside you, realising that you had fallen asleep and wondering, as he quietly admired you, what he ever did to deserve this. Ordinary never meant letting those brief touches from before become anything more, but here he was, acting on a feeling he couldn’t quite explain as he slowly shifts nearer to you and wraps an arm around your waist, careful not to wake you as he pulls you closer and letting himself, just this once, keep you close to him. — or, alternatively, in which you return to the military as an engineer where bullets are shot, tea is made and bruises are earned"

The information seemed irrelevant, but maybe any sort of intel will be helpful at this point when we have nothing.” “Very well. What is the man’s name, Floch?” “This man,” Floch pauses and scans the room, making eye contact with nearly all the attendees. “this man, suspected of being the War Hammer, has revealed his name to be Marco Bodt.” OR After the battle at Marley, the Eldians take a prisoner aboard their ship.

Reeling himself up higher up the armoured titan, Connie sprinted vertically best he could up its back. Grappling onto the large chunk of armour on his nape, the scout promptly propelled himself onto it. In plain frustration, he began to stab desperately at the lump of armour while trying to not fly off. Of course, it was obvious this would do nothing, he was being a mere nuisance- but fuck if the teen cared at that moment. But he'd soon need to realise he needed to care, as he just made probably the stupidest decision of his life, as the faint specs of the scout regiment began to fade more and more into the distance.

There is just something about the reader that the latter can't ignore, is it the fact that she's an enigma or that she's a though nut to crack. The story will have a lot of smut, action, angst and there will be some TWs throughout the whole story."

That's not going to make things easier,"" the judge muttered, tutting and flipping through a couple of papers whilst looking back and forth between them and the girl. ""Sorry,"" she mumbled, shuffling and adjusting the restraints her hands were in. The clanking of the chains echoed through the hall and she hissed once a piece of the metal caught and pinched her skin. Historia looked down at her from beside the judge apologetically, pouting slightly as she saw Ymir chained to the ground. Typically the monarch didn't take part in trial cases and only passes judgement once the trial had concluded but Historia had requested to supervise this time. ""Sorry, why are we doing this again?""

This was how she was going to die. Alone. Black spots danced in her vision. She probably had a concussion. A laugh escaped her lips.

She could accept this death. It was quite peaceful, actually, except, was that screaming she heard? - Claire Helios has been a member of the Scouts for years.

Snowfields of sand. Stars like coloured rivers in the sky.” Armin said nothing. “That’s how you dreamed it, after all.” This time Eren turned to stare Armin in the eye. Something there yanked at him, an emotion too great or too difficult to speak aloud. “It’s just what you imagined.” (When Eren disappears in Liberio, it causes the Survey Corps no end of problems. And when Armin dreams, he dreams of Eren. Spoilers up to chapter 120 or so.)"

They only had less than fourteen hours to get the water plane’s engine ready and to gather their bearings for what might just be their final confrontation with Eren. When Mikasa struggles in between the lies she kept telling herself from the awful truth, he, out of everyone, sees her for the fraud that she was - a terrified young girl hiding behind this invincible facade, clinging to the last anchor of her livelihood, burdened by unbearable guilt.

If one last night alive is all that they’ve been given, then it would be a night of no prohibitions - one that they’ll carry to their graves. When the dawn breaks, it is time to return to their agonizing reality - moving forward towards inevitable death, when staying alive was no longer a possible option.

"""Eren, love, what have you done?"" Levi soothes, his voice hitting Eren right in his heart. It aches, the discomfort radiates outwards and Eren hurts all over - he doesn't deserve Levi's affection. Embarrassment and shame floods his veins and Eren feels leaden, a heavy force sinking him to the ocean's deepest depths. ""Please make it stop,"" Eren whispers, his throat raw, from the sobbing or the vomit he's not sure. More likely than not, both. ""Let's get you out of here, hey?"" Levi queries, leaning over the edge of the bath as he runs his fingers through Eren's hair. His touch eases Eren's pain, although Eren loathes to admit his dependence.

"His eyes were like a hurricane of passion, filled with a thirst for life and dream of freedom; the soft blues waves of uncertainty and determination, with a hue of green, reminded her of the grass from Marley's gardens. She could gaze into those eyes forever, lost in the very colours that threatened to devour her, soul and body, completely. She loved everything about him — in a way only a fool would.

Erwin Smith is a man of many secrets and he doesn't have time to be involved in romance, especially since there was only one love for him, Marie.

"“He’s going to be okay. He’s been through much worse, Armin won’t let us down like that. I’m sure of it.” The girl said more to convince herself than to appease Eren. They held onto each other in the long corridor leading to the infirmary, silently praying for the one other person they really cared about to be okay. Hiding their faces in each other’s neck, they waited many long minutes for the time to pass. Neither had anything better to do and even if they tried, nothing would chase the image of their hurt friend away. Eren gently grabbed the side of Mikasa’s face to bring their foreheads together. His wet eyes shining with hazy tears, he whispered with a look of despair: “I love him.”"

"{What would happen if Levi had decided to save Erwin's life instead?} ""Did... Did you do it?"" Erwin asked, all Levi could do was stare back at him wide-eyed, ""did you kill the Beast Titan? Did all those lives that were lost mean something?"" That question felt like it mattered more than any answer he would find in the basement in that moment. The silence alone was enough to answer his question.

The two meet completely accidentally, but the beginning of their relationship is quite romantic: one of them saves the other's life. Brilliant, now they should kiss, right? It can't be this simple. What should be mentioned is that Rivai has wings and Eren is half-fish. And both of them are in danger exactly because of it."
"Eva Meyer is a new cadet, but different from the others, due to where she was brought up. A certain Captain doesn't enjoy this fact, and he singles her out.

He feels a bit cold, but it’s fine, compared to all the heat he felt before, and his vision is a bit cloudy, but that doesn’t keep him from distinguishing Mikasa's shape, doing compressions on his chest and giving him artificial respiration. If he has any regrets, it’s probably that the only kiss they shared was like this, thanks to the CPR, but it’s not a regret in itself, because dying in Mikasa's arms is the most pleasant thing. He thought that it would not happen, that when he died, it would be by the hand of Levi, or even Zeke, but he always thought he would disappear. Either deep in the earth or in his head, but disappear at last. He thought that he would not rest and, honestly, he was okay with that. Series: Canon!verse side stories [1]"

The one thing he did not need was for his mom, Hange, to begin dating his principle, Erwin Smith. And he definitely didn't need Annie, principle Erwin's gloomy goth daughter to move in with them. And the one thing he most certainly didn't need was to be partnered with Reiner Braun, the popular athletic kid whose grades are on a downward protectory and who desperately needs a tutor. But as long as he just puts his head down, gets on with it, and most importantly ignores the way he's beginning to feel around Reiner, he should be fine, right?"

But deep down, Mikasa knew, she knew that he was still alive. The real Eren was still alive, thriving in her head, in that endless summer afternoon. ... Eren's eyebrows pitched, his gaze lowered. How did he survive? All the guilt, the anger, the fear. Why did he do it? How did he do it? Carla's death, Hanne's sacrifice, Hanji's fate, so much more... all of them, they died because of him. It's because of him-but, thinking about the past will only hinder his future.

In the midst of his seasonal depression, he meets a peculiar group of people through a multiplayer online game. Bertholdt only wanted a distraction. What he didn't expect to find, were friends. Reiner Braun has always lived life by the seat of his pants. He had everything he could ask for and more. The world appeared to have been handed to him on a silver platter. But no amount of luxuries had ever been able to patch up the hole left by the ghost of his childhood.

"Eren stared at Levi, looking at the dips and hollows of her body. Levi glared, crossing her arms and drawing Eren's attention back to the slight swell of Levi's chest, which was secured with a bandeau, peeking underneath her white button down. A swell which Eren had NOT expected, in all his years of imaging Levi bare underneath him. Not at all. ""Had your fill yet?"" Eren stared, disbelieving. His hand twitched and ached to follow the paths his eyes had taken, relearning the new contours of Levi's partially unclothed body - but he stopped himself. Levi was not all how his brain conjured him up, but Eren wholeheartedly believed that Levi was still capable of breaking the bones of his hand if he ever attempted to touch her without her permission. ""But - how?"" Levi rolled her eyes. ""I was always like this, Eren. You assumed I was a man, and I just didn't bother correcting you."" -- In which Eren is besotted with his entirely male Captain and finds out that all his preconcieved notions about Levi are incorrect.

It’s both a blessing and a curse, to be loved so intensely, passionately, so completely. She fucks him the way she loves him. The way she protects him. Filled with desperation and adoration, with love, with the concern of not hurting him, but only providing him with the highest of comforts and happiness. It’s almost as if she feeds off his joy and contentment. It’s overwhelming, it takes over him and his body and soul and mind, he feels like he’s floating in the clouds somewhere up in the sky, his thoughts are muddled, and his body is pliant and soft and oh so fuckin weak. Usually, he would hate being like this. He hates being weak. He hates being vulnerable. But this is Mikasa."

Your mastery of ODM gear and steeliness in the face of titans causes you to quickly rise through the ranks, even though you detest the attention. Finally, you find yourself in part of the most elite squad. The undertones of disdain and grudging respect between you is mutual. They think you don't deserve to be there, you don't really care. You haven't cared about anything for a long time. You didn't think there could be anyone colder than you, until you meet your new captain. Can the two of you remember how to be human again?"

"“The flowers are beautiful.” I adored the way the words rolled off his tongue, the sentence spoken as if it were a gift from God himself. Perhaps to me, it was. Anything he said to me, of importance or not, made my heart beat faster and my face burn up. It was a surprise he hadn’t noticed yet, with my interest being far too conspicuous in the presence of anyone with half a brain. Perhaps he simply didn’t care to point it out and feigned ignorance on purpose. Unlike other friends I had, I knew full well the reasoning behind my affections. He had saved me, and not just physically. Erwin Smith was the reason I was still alive, and the reason I wasn’t stuck in poverty as I had been when I met him."

"Eren, why did you save me if you knew this was to come, why are you so cruel to me. Sorrow racked his body as through a thousand spears had punctured his chest. He desperately whispered out “Please,…Eren” Suddenly Armin felt a soft brush of skin against his cheek. He looked up to see Eren crouched next to him on the ground gently holding his face in his calloused palm. Armin studied the ridges along his palm. Long lines ending in broken, jagged dead ends. Armin remembered being told once upon a time that they represented the lifeline of their beholder. How appropriate those jagged edges were, how many more would they cut to pieces before they died out. Armin was stirred from his thoughts by Eren’s voice above him. Except it wasn’t Eren’s voice. It echoed out from the vastness like a beehive buzzing all as one. “All will be as it should.”"
"Shiganshina, 850. Levi held out hope, but with no sign of their commander, the Survey Corps leave the battle bruised, decimated, and without their leader.

Also for a good experience maybe listen to ""Ghost of you"", I listened to it while writing this Fic!!"
"To Armin, It’s enough to have comrades that you know you’ll die for. It’s illogical to love someone more than friends, when nobody can tell if they’ll last to the next day. He sees the way Hannah cries over Franz’s corpse, desperately trying to breathe life back into his lungs, and he thinks to himself that love is just too sad in a world like this. You don’t have a choice about loving family, but you have a choice to not fall in love with someone else you might lose any second.

A spinoff from the previous two works in this series focusing on the relationship between Armin and Levi (and what they do every chapter that Armin's missing). The story starts out with Armin/Marco and Armin/Everyone, but it's a slow burn development towards Rivarmin."

He seems to be four years older, his freckled face full of maturity and sturdiness, his gray eyes gleaming with shattered naivety. He also has teeth marks and scars of when that titan had… ate him, and it seems they will not be going away. He takes a deep breath, trying not to feel self conscious about all this. or; Marco is given a second chance and is flung to the Year 854, fully aged up, and during the time Jean Kirschtein is in Marley serving as a spy for Paradis."
"She had hoped this would happen differently. In an ideal world, it would have. They’d have been blushing and fumbling. Awkward laughter. Unsure hands. Soft kisses. All of it. In an ideal world, this would have played out like her fantasies—tender and loving. But the world is ending. For the umpteenth time. She’s lost count.

"[GAME SYSTEM INSPIRED BY ALICE IN BORDERLAND & HUNGER GAMES COMBINED, BUT THE STORY AND MOST OF THE CHARACTERS ARE NOT!] You never expected your life to turn out this way.

"Waking up without memories is confusing enough under normal circumstances. Now imagine waking up without memories, only to discover you're an orphan now, and human like monsters are destroying everything you've ever known, holding your entire life captive behind abandoned walls.

Whenever Historia would move to slap Ymir, it would turn her on versus making her angry. They would find themselves fucking on anything possible, fueled by their rage and passion.

He feels some part of him get wrenched away, run through with an electric current so strong it threatens to tear him limb from limb. It doesn’t--it never does.

"Zeke's presence eventually became a comfort companion for Hange, who lost their spark after losing many of their comrades. However, the comfort given by Zeke was a momentary tranquility that Hange couldn't ask for more."
"Your life was boring, Your career nowhere you where nothing special.

Who would have thought, then, that trapped on an island, she'd find the freedom she desired. But who is the apathetic man that inhabits this place?

"“You think,” Jean said slowly, “that the Devil Titan wrote Eren Jaeger out of existence?” . . ."
"Eren is not a simple man, he doesn’t want simple things, and he doesn’t love, simply. Because as much as he wants Mikasa to be happy, the thought of her forgetting him twists inside him painfully, a knife in his already diminishing soul. or cabin eren likes that mikasa grew her hair longer. (so he can pull on it when he's fucking her from behind)"

"It happened so quickly - he was driving away from home after a heated argument with his manipulative mother, he was out of his mind, he was angry, sad, and upset... and he hit Marco. He hit his previous classmate, his friend, the guy who could understand his family issues. Yeah, Reiner broke his nose, fractured some of his ribs, and had a couple of bruises and abrasions on his sides , but his raven-haired friend pulled the shorter end of the stick: he almost went half-blind, he had several broken bones, and after his long and painful stay in the hospital he catched a really bad respiratory infection. Could he ever forgive Reiner? Or the better question: could Reiner ever forgive himself?"
"'You liars! Fucking bastards. You lied to me all my life. I hate you. I hate you so much. Don’t ever call me your son again!' He clutched his hair as the image of Hange's wet cheeks and a burning handprint left by Levi on the left cheek appeared right in front of his eyes. He felt as if there was an endless pit right in his gut, in the place his mother used to kiss and rub when he got bloated as a child. No They deserved it. They lied to me all this time."

"Eren had eyes following him since he was twelve years old. At first, it terrified him. Someone was watching him, stalking him. Eventually the fear grew familiar, and almost fond. The goosebumps turned into anticipation. The heavy weight of the stare used to feel oppressive. Now it just feels like love."
"Punished for his cold attitude, Levi is sent to the human world by his superior Erwin. In order to not scare the humans because he is a demon, Levi has to wonder around the human world for a month as a black cat. Humans and Demons are aware of each other and want to connect, but Demons are so socially awkward or excited that humans are scared. Levi isn't keen on the humans, but when he's over there he meets a sweet kind woman, you. At first he rejects you, he eventually goes home with you. Not knowing Levi is a demon, he lives with you and sees how broken you are. With a manipulative and selfish best friend around you, as well as a creepy landlord spying on you, Levi is determined to fix it all, because you are deeply a good person.

"It takes a little over two months for Levi to accept that Kenny ain’t coming back. Kenny would’a called that self-indulgent.  Levi knows it, sure as he knows his own name.  But he couldn’t really help it none. // Levi's childhood in the Underground."
"Hange Zoe supposes that all great interrogations start with torture rather than lead up to it—after all, the direct introduction to pain is one of the best deterrents of dissidence, and theoretically if one were weak enough to fess up quickly, they’d do so immediately at the sight of such frightening tools as nail pliers and bone saws. It saves time, and in the case that the informant turned out to have more of a steely resolve than expected, then torture would do nothing but weaken said resolve. It’s a win-win either way."
"Levi saw Erwin through a computer screen, where sand and sun had kissed his flesh, stained his cheeks and neck. He looked so beautiful like that, even though he was on the other side of the world fighting a war that Levi didn’t believe in. But he believed in Erwin, always had. The man had these visions of grandeur, this idea that he owed someone something, this unrelenting sense of devotion that he would burn himself down for. There wasn’t much Levi put his faith in: he worshipped no god, prayed no prayers, didn’t wish on shooting stars nor copper coins tossed to water fountains. But he believed in Erwin with a force he couldn’t yield or contain. Wherever those blue eyes looked, Levi would look also. So when Erwin whispered in his ear before stepping onto that plane, bidding his husband goodbye, saying ‘I’ll come home to you, my love’, Levi took it as more than a promise. He took it as gospel; written in stone and blood and cosmic stardust. I’ll come home to you, my love."
"Levi lays Erwin to rest"
"When Armin gets word of Eren’s location, he takes off to go find him. Never mind a thought-out plan—they need to talk, and they need to do it now. Eren’s expecting him. He’s uninterested in just talking."
"hange learned long ago they are not good at this sort of thing. who needs to speak of emotion when you can simply drag someone down to the corner shop, kicking up dirt in your combined wake, and buy them an ice cream which you’ll then steal a lick from? it’s been ages since they’ve as much as seen an ice cream and they’re beginning to think they’ll need to start getting creative. ; or, the author is sad and projecting onto hange through an attempt at a found family fic :]"

Will she be able to save them all, especially Levi, who tends to end up dead again and again? Can she face her true feelings for a certain friend?"
"The kid’s got lice. Well, Kenny guesses he shouldn’t be surprised.  Comin’ from that fuckin’ shit-ass, rat infested hellhole Kuchel’d given herself over to, ‘course the kid had lice.  Probably had a whole buncha’ other shit wrong with him too.  No doubt. // Kenny takes Levi home."
"It was in rare moments like this that Eren was aware of how much his admiration for the famous Captain Levi had morphed into something more. His respect for the older man had never quivered, not even when he got to know the real him, his short temper and unfiltered words, but something else had. What had started like a small sparkle lit during his daydreams of joining the Survey Corps, when Levi was still only his idol, had now turned into a full fire, burning brighter the more time he spent under Levi’s mentorship."
"Mikasa had always found it astonishing how a photograph could capture a single moment. And Eren agreed, because he wanted Mikasa to have something that reminded her of him."
"The only hue that stained his monochrome world - Red. The colour was everywhere.  Red blemishing those slender digits of his, red flowing in gutters, red was the water in which he bathed, red was the colour he couldn't escape. Titans- this was a very well-known name in Trost City , every single person wished they wouldn't ever encounter it. Who wouldn't? Titans were a ruthless group killing anyone that ever crossed paths with them. Their leader , Kenny Ackerman , a sadistic bastard who did not want his autocracy over Trost to end. He nourished on the fear of others. Even the cops feared him. And Of Course, not to forget his right hand without whom Kenny was nothing, Levi Ackerman. Another infamous group, but less cruel than The Titans was - Survey Corps. The rivalry between these two groups was very well heard of, could also result in deaths of many innocents. Eren Yeager, member of Survey Corps who swore he would avenge his mother's death. His sole purpose was to kill Kenny Ackerman who dared to pierce his mother's skull with the filthy bullet of his gun. What will happen when the two rivals meet? Will Eren be able to pull off that blindfold of revenge and be able to see affection in Levi's eyes?"

"He was what home meant to her: a vision of spending an eternal summer slacking, sleeping in the meadows, watching the sky. Home was a world meant just for the two of them. A world like today."
"""He who wears the crown shall become king. The crown may fall, but the king is still king."" - There’s a big difference between acting and lying, Levi thinks. To act, you must be skilled, calculated, and fully portray the role you’re given. To lie, all you have to do is leave things out. Ignore the truth. Add syllables to your daily speech and hope it deceives the person in front of you. Pray your cards don’t fumble when it’s time to play. But Levi knows this all too well. He is an actor after all. And Levi lies, but acting is far easier. And lying is far worse. - Inspired by Mitski's 'Liquid Smooth'."

But Eren can't ignore Jean once he witnesses something disturbing happening in the Kirstein house. After that, all Eren wants to do in the world is be there for Jean."
"I guess I can say I’ve never truly believed in ghosts. It was more of an acceptance. A sort of understanding that the shadows that lurked around the dustiest corners of my room weren’t just passing cars or mice skittering across the floorboards. I understood that there was something there, but I kind of just let it be. I should introduce myself. My name is Jean Kirschstein, and  my life just got a bit more complicated. Jean's had a pretty boring life. He's working off the expenses of moving out of the shithole known as Shiganshina. But when a man named Marco shows up, complete with mysterious burns all along his arms, asking for a job at Trost Books things are about to get a little more complicated. Who is Marco? And why the hell is Jean so damn gay."
"Titans. They were gigantic droids that were created for the sole purpose to be man kind's body guards, however, a virus infiltrated corrupting their data base, leading to man's kind's bleak fate. Levi is an droid built for one purpose. Eliminate the titans. The scouting legion's scientists could only have dreamed of creating such a perfect model, and now that he was finally built, hope arose. There were some some restrictions Levi had to follow in order to be kept in full function. He couldn't become close friends with any of his comrades, he couldn't be excepted into any family, and above all, he couldn't fall in love. Should he have broken anyone one of those, his system would be shut down. The scouting legion realized one droid couldn't handle such an enormous task in his metallic hands. Thus, droid Eren Jeager was created, along with a whirlwind of trouble."

He wanted to bring his own peace to an unknown place and hide there, but his own peace has passed away. His own peace has gone to a place, where he was not only his own peace anymore, and his peace also faded away with Levi’s shadow. His own peace has gone, so Erwin’s heart was shaking again."

I’m right here with you.” Jean wasn’t listening, or if he was, it certainly didn’t show - His grip around Marco’s neck refusing to lessen, even at the reassuring words and comforting strokes down his back that followed. There was a faint murmuring in the otherwise silent room, so quiet Marco wouldn’t even have noticed if it hadn’t matched the hot intakes of breath against his neck. It took all of his strength to pry his fellow cadet off of him, holding Jean upright by the shoulders once more. “What are you saying, Jean? I can’t make you out.” “You were dead. I saw you. We burned you. I wasn’t there, I didn’t even see it happen, I wasn’t there with you and you-” “Died? Look at me, Jean, look at me. You were just having a bad dream. A nightmare. That’s all it was. I’m here with you right now.”"

"""All there is left is the stinging reminder that Levi will never be any of what Erwin sees in him. His mistake had been to let Erwin coerce him into believing he was better than himself. Levi is no virtuosic musician, he is not studious, not clever, loving or funny, and he’s definitely not put together. His broken bits scattered here and there may have been quirky at best, but he’s not a man who’s ever been proper enough to be called that. Erwin had told him it was charming. Quirks and charms are adjectives for people who laugh around flutes of expensive champagne and don’t scrub toilets for a living. They’re not things for Levi. No, down where he’s from, it’s called annoyance and means of survival."" Another missing scene told from Levi's POV. Contains spoilers for CODA."

"Prince Jean, heir of the French throne is meeting his new servant. And something is wrong. So wrong. What is happening? Why does he feel weird while seeing this guy. Marco, that's the name which will change Jean's life."
"Sometimes we shouldn't give into curiosity. After all, ignorance is bliss."
"You weren't here with me. So when I wake up in the past, I'll take you to the future with me."
"See you later Eren , see you later my most beloved, my dear that what you are to me, instead of saying them right into your face here I am writing them on your stone I didn’t say it that day because I thought if I tell you this you might not feel the same way and I would lose you but now I lost you forever because I didn’t tell you I was coward I wish If I had told you what you are to me, I’m paying the price for not telling you, price I can’t afford"
"What do you do when you run into your ex of seven years? ..... “Eren!” you softly cried out. Vocal cords tightening up as you watched the man slowly turn to face you. Strands of dark brown hair stringing across his angular face as his emerald green eyes racked through the crowd of people before finally focusing on you. His raised eyebrows softening as he blinked three times. The first blink was short. A normal blink, your average timed blink. The second blink was bit longer, like a slow realization. The third blink was shorter than the rest, as if he was coming to a quick resolution. You raised your hand out of your coat pocket, loosening your fingers and opening up your palm as you gave a quick and subtle wave. A modest smile appearing on your red lips as you mouthed the words, “Hi.”"
"The Survey Corps get their way at the trial. Eren Yeager’s custody is with the Scouts, however, there is a lot of distrust among the Corps and special requests are made to allow this to happen. Or, the military police won’t allow the Survey Corps to have custody of Eren unless he wears a muzzle."
"In the Underground, every day is a guess of whether you’ll make it back to your bed at night. Starvation, plagues, violence, despair. After discovering the murder of her last living relative, and the ominous message left solely for her, Vada must rely on her friends Furlan, Isabel, and Levi for a sense of safety. But for just how long can she hide from someone with eyes all over the dark city? And for just how long can Levi and Vada deny the feelings threatening to spill over the surface?"
"“Kenny got up and tossed a couple coins on the bar before grabbing his hat and stepping briskly out the door. “Levi.” He barked, and the boy was right at his side. The kid knew not to ask questions, and he followed silently. That is, until he yelped out his guardians name. “Kenny!” He cried, and the man whipped around and saw the little black head that had been bobbing at his side was gone, and a gang of three men were struggling with something in the alley they had just passed by.” Levi gets kidnapped."
"The heavy flurry of the snowflakes soaked through her wool beanie, freezing her head as she knocked once again on Ymir’s door. Or Dr. Bodt’s door. The cold was soaking through her body as she waited for her to come. Slow, thudding footsteps grew louder until Historia heard the click of the lock as the door opened. Right in front of her was Dr. Bodt, the psychiatrist she had been working with on this case. For the past year, Historia and others at the station were working on a case with a serial killer. Historia found a connection between the majority of them - they were patients of Dr. Ymir Bodt. Naturally, Historia decided to check out the doctor and see if she could be the killer. Obviously, Ymir was not the one murdering people, but she offered to help with the investigation. Ymir had studied abnormal psychology and was well-versed with people who hurt others. Over the year, Historia and Ymir found each other working very closely with each other. She frequented her house often for dinners where they would discuss the case together. However, Historia always found herself wondering about Ymir. A horror-themed one shot for Halloween :) Enjoy serial killer Ymir and detective Historia!!!!"
"If the night before heading out to Shiganshina had gone differently, if Levi had been given a little bit more hope."
"Erwin sat on the edge of his bed, feet dangling over the side. He had been crying and now he felt empty. Numb, hollow. The voices in his head played like a broken record, repeating the same thing over and over again. The pained voices of those he had led to their deaths, those he had killed. Their screams of anguish as a titan ripped them in half. The angry screams of family members blaming him. And it was his fault. Their deaths, their blood all over his hands."
"Erwin is tired of the endless cycle Levi seams to have no interest in breaking"
"Commander Erwin Smith is livid with you after you joined a bloody battle after explicit orders to not participate. He's dragged you back to his office to yell at you about it."

But will it be everything Levi has dreamed it would be? And is it safe to finally let his guard down?"
"The Smith family had to conceal the birth of their only son and hide their true nature. To anyone watching, the Smiths were the perfect white American family. They even had a white picket fence, and a Collie called Winona. Young Erwin was a brilliant child, and for that reason, his dad became a househusband to tutor his boy while his wife worked as a firewoman to feed the family. They didn’t live in poverty, and his dad taught him, as soon as he could understand that nobody could know about his Special Abilities."
"After suffering a loss, that crushed your soul, you pack up and leave behind a life that caused you more harm than good and move to a town deep within Paradis in the hope of a better life. Transferring to Trost State University, you cross paths with someone who once meant the world to you, someone who you thought you lost forever.

Soon, you find your life beginning to intertwine with a group of close-knit friends who help you rediscover who you are. However, there is one person in particular that you are told to watch out for.

The country, the people, the city. Especially the club's manager Levi, who doesn't seem to give a shit about anyone other than himself. This was originally written as a roleplay. It's completely finished and ended up somewhere around 340k words, that is 60~ chapters. So buckle up, this is gonna be a long one! And mind the tags!"
"There is something tempting about chaos. Perhaps it is the falling apart, the loss of control, the disorder, the lack of form - is that it? The desire to fall apart? Why does one want to fall apart? ____ The cultural and political hegemony of Jaeger Press House faces an unexpected challenger when a new author appears in town. Levi Ackerman's 'Metaphysics' rouses interest in many of Shiganshina's citizens, but the reaction it sparks within the young student Eren Jaeger may turn out to have greater consequences than anyone could have foreseen. Levi Ackerman is the master of taking things apart, of dismantling, of deconstruction; and he might just tear everything asunder - for better or for worse."
"An Eremika Halloween Special College was really a struggle for Eren, but good thing he has a nice brother who got his back! Zeke invited Eren for a camp in the woods with just the two of them.

"The distance between Eren and Historia is vast. She tries to traverse it, but things go wrong. They'll never be the same again. But they try finding each other and themselves again through convoluted words and actions. Written for Day 7 of EH Smut Week. Not exactly BDSM but things get heated."

"Despite her recent promotion, Hange can’t help but fall back into her old habits endured during her days as squad leader.  Luckily for her, Levi is there to remind her, but caring for the 14th commander of the survey corps doesn't come without its fair amount of obstacles.  Hange is too stubborn to bathe in favor of completing the work she has buried herself in, to which hijinks quickly ensue.  Levihanjinks, if you will. Levi offers Hange his support after the retaking of Shiganshina as they recover from their recent losses and emotionally prepare to face hell across the ocean with Hange as the new commander."
"ive never posted on ao3 before but i am desperate."
"Eren and Historia are finally back together."
"As much as the people of the planet Paradis joked about the very thought of the Survey Corps, it was still considered a something for those who wanted to escape their largely isolationist, and quite frankly stupid, society. It had been the sole reason Eren Yeager had signed up for the first place when he was fifteen. He wasn't interested in being stuck on his homeworld. He wanted to see beyond the wall his people had created and craved. Isolation and stagnation may have suited the adults. But for someone like Eren, it was like being stuffed into a cage and forced to accept it. * Attack on Titan in space, minus the Titans. But Eren still hates his brother."

You’re clearly sick.” “No, I’m not.

"He didn't know what he was doing at her door step in the middle of the night. He didn't know what he expected when she opened the door. All he knew is that he had to have her, like a starved man roaming the desert. He wanted that soft look at the sunset be the same when she looked at him. Levi knew he this was insanity, and he is willingly going crazy."
"Jean knew better than to read Pieck’s journal while she was in the shower. She was preparing herself for their New Year’s Eve party. Their friends would all be coming over to celebrate as they always have. Jean couldn't stop himself from running his fingers over the soft paper pages of the leather bound journal that Pieck brought everywhere she went. He couldn’t help but read the words that she had written in black ink. Most entries were inconsequential, simply written about the job that Pieck hated and wanted nothing more than to be freed of. He wished he had stopped then and there. Jean wished he had chosen to mind his own business and didn’t flip to her most recent entry and read those words."

"Erwin was 12-year-old when he realised he would always be misunderstood. And that was fine. Nobody was completely understood all the time, he knew that. He knew that well. Yet, it hurt."
"Oh, what a wretched life they lived. Hitch is put in charge of protecting Eldia from the cursed and evil Annie. But she can't help but wonder, is there more to her than everyone believes?"
"Armin wakes up to the sensation of agony. What, or who happened and why? He is pretty sure he's been assaulted in his own home. However, there is no sign of any culprit."
"All his life she was trained for when this moment would come. At the age of sixteen, she must finally obey orders and volunteer as Tribute, only then will she be able to satisfy her father.

"What you were: prepared to join the Military Police, as per Lord Reiss's instructions. Your mind was sharp, your body trained, and your will resigned. What you were not: prepared to meet Eren Jaeger. He was a lightning strike in a summer storm sort of boy, the kind that was brilliantly there and then gone in a flash, leaving spots in your vision. What you would never be: prepared to love Eren Jaeger. He took your breath away, that beautiful boy with his never-broken oaths. You always found each other, in every life you lead. He had promised as much, after all, in another universe, another time - and he never broke his promises. What neither of you realized was that you always lost each other, too - and this time was no different."
"Even when everything was over, haunting images of what happened were deeply engraved inside Erwin's soul, haunting him, whenever he tried to sleep. The one coming to him tonight was especially bad, but just like there, Levi is there to lead the way."

"An alternate future where Ymir made a different choice. Follows the events of Attack on Titan had Ymir chosen to stay with Historia at the end of season 2."
"They find Ymir on the outskirts of town on her hands and knees, crying profusely into the lake beneath her body. She’s half submerged and it’s a shock to find that her clothing isn’t wet, isn’t even wrinkled. Her limbs simply sit in the still water that bears no ripples, no wetness, no moisture, nothing except quiet acceptance of Ymir’s abundance of tears. So, she'd found out about Historia and the farmer and the cursed requirement of pregnancy. “I saw them,” Ymir’s voice pierces the quiet air. It’s rife with anguish, agony, such a great grating exhaustion that it rattles Sasha’s bones to hear. She shouldn’t be so tired long after her death. She doesn’t deserve this. Below her body, the water doesn’t ripple. “It was an accident. I just wanted to visit. I—I saw her lay down with tears in her eyes and left before I could see more.”"

"It was a time when people desired to murder the most, yet no longer hired assassins. An age of backstabbing and lawsuits with radiant smiles. A time where progress rolled on well-oiled cogs but going backwards. Intellectuals teemed about like pigeons around old bits of bread, yet the world had plunged into absolute idiocy. Warmth felt cold and cold felt like piping hot apple pies fresh off the oven. And Levi Ackerman was an unemployed ex-assassin who hadn’t done a single hit in seven years and was quickly running out of money to pay for the rent of his shitty flat with the meagre money he got from his odd jobs. He was good at virtually all kinds of manual work. And he was especially good at cleaning."

But he came back in a way no ever thought."

"Levi swore to Erwin he would kill the Beast Titan. But how can he follow such an order when it's Erwin himself he pulls from its nape?"
"The land of Paradis has been ruled by two houses who’ve had almost a century long feud… until now."

"""God is compassionate and merciful. It was love that moved him to create us and commit to us"" Just a drabble"
"-He couldn't stand the sight of the body anymore while she wanted nothing more than to lay there for eternity. She had spent hours holding Erwin's limp hand while they searched that basement. He wanted to be there so bad but he never made it. With an aggravated sigh, Levi decided he couldn't stand there and watch this any longer. It hurt too much. He knows that losing Erwin means losing her too. Her heart couldn't take losing another person she loved.- Currently being written as a short story but might make it longer- we'll see."
"After a long, grueling day of experiments with Hange, Eren runs right into a member of the Garrison Regiment and discovers that a kind face can hide a monster beneath. Heavy Trigger Warning: Graphic description of sexual assault and its aftermath. If you are struggling with sexual trauma or this material will trigger you, please do not read this. Take care of yourself. In summary, I kin Eren and I'm trying to process my own trauma, so I wrote this as a kind of experiment."
"One picture. Four years. Feels like a world of difference. A collection of connected one shots."
"**Some background knowledge before you read?** The Scouts: A professional dance group consisting of Hange, Levi, Eren, Mikasa, Jean, Armin, Connie, and Sasha. Erwin isn’t in it because he and the rest of the original squad lost their lives (or in Erwin’s case, his arm) in a plane crash. Levi used to be a professional violinist with his two friends. Moblit is the choreographer of the Scouts and he’s Hange’s partner. The Scouts all wear green jackets with the logo of a blue and white wing on a shield on their backs. Levi’s favorite drink is a London Fog from Starbucks. For team bonding nights the dance group usually goes out to bars to drink, but since they picked up a bunch of new people fresh out of Maria Academy (they call their students Cadets) Hange’s adamant that they not get arrested for six fake IDs. So now they go to Erwin’s house (Levi’s house too, but he doesn’t tell them that), and they watch movies and Erwin cooks because Levi would burn the house down if he cooked (because he takes forever since he’s a perfectionist)."
"“Where’s Marie?” He asked, watching Levi’s face cloud with something strange for a moment. His hand moved from Erwin’s hairline, dropping to his lap. He seemed to shrink, growing smaller until he composed himself, sliding from the bed to the chair beside it. “How should I know? At work probably.” Erwin stared down at Levi’s hands, at the plain gold band nudged onto his slender ring finger. He’d been single the last time they had spoken, single and— “But—” Erwin started, trying to find words in his foggy mind. The last he remembered was going to work. The firm in California. A junior position had turned senior quickly, and with one of his bosses so close to retirement, he was so close to making partner. He’d kissed Marie goodbye in the kitchen, a promise to be home early for once. She had been despondent of late, and he’d wanted to cheer her up. “Levi, I haven’t seen you for two years. Why are you here?” Levi stared at him, open-mouthed, he closed it and pulled his hands down until they folded neatly in his lap. “I think maybe I should call a doctor.” ___ Modern Setting/Amnesia AU"
"Upon sharing the trait of not liking humans, you and Levi form some sort of bond that he's willing to kill to protect."
"Most of these are just short stories with lots of smut. Enjoy :)"
"oneshots of little!bertholdt because if no one else will, then i have to i take suggestions, so please leave them only on chapter 1 so it’s easier to keep track of them :)"
"Death, loss, and suffering was and is something that isn’t new to Levi. Rather, it is the only constant thing in his life. He only wanted to help give the kids living Underground a chance at a normal life. For them to not experience what he went through but as the scouts were on one of their errands of fetching orphans, the Survey Corps ended up having another criminal from the Underground as a soldier, Y/N. Y/N being one of the unfortunate to have been born underground with no citizenship to permanently stay on the surface, she had endured living in the confines of the subterranean city. And rather than choosing between death and being a harlot to live, she chose to be one of the underground’s bane by being a thief and a member of one of the Underground's notorious crime groups. Life for Y/N was just her doing everything she could to survive with the kids in her care and when the news of the King being replaced started to go around the Underground, she just kept on going as she used to, thinking that the changes in the ruler of the walls would only affect those who live above. Until Y/N was surprised to come home one night to an empty house."
"""I heard he wasn’t there when his friends were attacked. Even he couldn’t save them."" Plagued by guilt after losing Furlan and Isabel to a Titan Attack, Levi returns to the Survey Corps Headquarters a changed man. But after a mysterious attempt on then-Section Commander Erwin's life pushes the two of them together, he finds he isn't the only one whose demons keep them awake at night... Set immediately after the events of the No Regrets OVA/Manga, this story explores how Erwin and Levi went from unlikely allies to the dynamic duo we know and love, while helping each other deal with the ghosts of their past."
"The kingdom of Maria has been ruled by Erwin Smith since he was twenty. Being king is not a position he particularly enjoys, but one he feels is his duty to live out. He once had dreams and inhibitions, but ultimately abandoned them for the sake of humanity. Five years after his crowning and nearly seven after the passing of his father, he meets an unruly assassin who will change the course of his history."
"It's only by chance that Eren Yeager meets Mikasa Ackerman on a bright, sunny day. He falls for her quickly, but it was impossible for him to know then that the great love of his life would also be the one to slip through his fingers. As they both lead their lives, first together then apart, neither quite forget about each other for very long."
"The awkwardness that he exuded is gone when he sharply turns around. He marches back to the ice-cold bench Mikasa’s sitting on for who knows how long with a newfound determination set in his eyes. “I don’t know what the hell your problem with me is but you’re the one who started this!” “I know you’ve been helping me!” his green eyes dared her to deny it. He cuts her incoming excuses off “I’m not stupid!” Mikasa silently helped him even before he was deemed ""cool"" and ""popular"". High school sucks. Sitting alone in a desolated dark corner, unfazed (as always) by how cold it was. Snowflakes in her hair, misty breath. How can he leave her alone? He pondered. “...I look like him don’t I?” Suddenly, she appears younger, vulnerable, nothing like the Mikasa Ackerman everyone thinks they know and is secretly envious of. Gray eyes briefly flashed with heartbreak. That settled it in Eren’s mind, she didn't even need to answer. Eren threw his jacket back to her. “I don’t know who the fuck you’re seeing through me but I never hated you, Mikasa. Don’t be selfish and let me help you.” he hated how bitter he sounds. Eren hastily wrapped the red scarf around Mikasa, not giving her any chance to protest."
"Marco Bodt knows there has to be something wrong with him. As an eighteen year old, he should be in college making friends and stressing over homework, maybe getting drunk or high or something here and there. He definitely should not be living with his parents, suffering from severe asthma, panic attacks, and depression. But here he is. Until one day, something strange happens that forces Marco out of his comfort zone... and into the arms of a new friend?"
"(ONGOING) practicing writing in the second-person pov"
"*This is a LevixReader fic. There will be frequent smut, and absolutely no spoilers. Please keep the comments spoiler free as well.* It's been two weeks since Y/N was hired by Erwin to tutor Levi in writing, and she hasn't taught him a single thing. He isn't happy about Erwin's new hire, so she spends her days reading in Levi's office. Today, his curiosity about Y/N won out. He read a page of her book and was shocked at what he found. Maybe Y/N isn't as annoying as he originally thought."
"Behind the clouds two moons shine. One is bigger than the other, both of them equally radiant. “My mother used to tell me the story about the lovers who escaped the terrors of Paradis and found their home in the night sky.” Levi hums, taking in the moons one last time before turning around to meet Eren’s eyes. ""I envy them."" * A pilot, a mercenary, a thief, a droid, an EOD specialist, a captain and a rebel - they're Paradis' only hope."
"Eren and Mikasa have run away together, leaving Armin behind to pick up the pieces. Unable to pursue his friends, he is faced with an impossible task. Save the people of Paradis, free the Eldians from persecution, and stay alive."
"Levi Ackerman hates the rain"
"Young Prince of Maria, Eren Jaeger, and Prince of Sina, Levi, spend every day of their childhood together. It seems they are inseparable as if enamored by one another. Every time Levi visits, Eren's world lights up again. That is until the day he finds his friend will never return to him. He never loses hope. And somehow, as if a gift from the Gods, Levi finds his way back to him- in the most unexpected way."
"Have you ever heard of the Ackermans? It is said that if an Ackerman dedicates his loyalty to you, then you will have the humanity's strongest soldier by your side, no matter what. As the owner of the Colossal Titan, Erwin intends to acquire the Ackerman's loyalty as well. And he'll do anything to bend him to his will."
"Evangeline ""Lee"" Beck is a captain of the Marleyan military who traveled to Paradis Island with Reiner, Marcel, Annie, and Bertholt. After spending years among the scouts, failing to retrieve the Founding Titan, and witnessing the death of two of their peers, Reiner and Lee return to Liberio with emotional trauma and mixed feelings about their home nation, Marley. Will they be able to put aside their differences and discover where their loyalties really belong? SLOW burn, enemies to lovers. Eventual smut. Fake dating. Note: The beginning takes place after the Marleyan victory at Fort Slava and before Willy Tybur's declaration of war. Contains canon diversion AND spoilers for Season 4 of Attack on Titan."
""" There was.. A whole lot I wanted to tell that idiot but- "" it was too late for those thoughts. Levi has regrets, Levi has secrets, Levi wants to go back in time, Levi wants him back."
"Petra always knew she'd have to marry him one day. Erwin Smith, the most powerful and dangerous man she knew, was going to claim her as his own. And he did. He took her from her old life, her family, and brought her into a world of wealth and danger the likes of which she'd never imagined. He introduced her to pleasure and pain without end. He made her his plaything. She didn't know much, but she knew one thing was true: she was going to get her fucking revenge. AU: Our world, mafia/gangster"
"There was no denying what Eleonora was seeing as her eyes gazed upon the delicate lines across his muscled shoulder blade. The world tilted slightly sideways and her her blood rushed through her ears as she stared at the constellation drawn on his back, it looked just like she used to draw on the sides of her book pages. Eleonora stared for what felt like an eternity as everything in her life had turned upside down once again. ""Anyone but him."" She whispered to anyone who would hear her plea. AOT soulmate AU no one asked for with a twist to the world building of the story"

"""What if, that day, I choose another answer, wouldn't it have come to something other than this..."" What would happened ? Let's explore. To you, who lived 2000 years after..."
"None"
"They might have been only three little kids, living off scraps and anger. But they had lived and they had dreamt and they had made it here to the end of the world. Because Eren has always been so much like a fire. A fire that’s destructive and burning and ever-alight. But also like the fire one keeps at home, warm and filled with promises. The type of fire she’d see Armin wave his hands on top of, fast enough to not get burnt, like a little magic trick. Mikasa likes to think even the stones in the land miss Eren. The useless walls that encircle her little world miss him. Every tree, every friend, every death given to Paradis. She thinks of this and she feels insane. Or: Moments in the life of a devoted heart. Memories, dreams, goodbyes. A love letter to Armin, Eren and Mikasa, and the end of the world."
"You, Levi, and Erwin have been together for years, but there's always been a strange distance between you and Levi. You've yearned to get closer to Levi for a while, but his cold demeanor has always discouraged you. Erwin's unexpected death leaves an even bigger gap between the two of you. You realize that you both deeply loved Erwin, but never quite connected with each other in the same way. Will his death drive you and Levi apart, or will his absence give you both the strength to confront your seemingly unrequited feelings towards one another? With no one else to turn to for comfort but each other, you both realize that you need one another more than you know, and the feelings you share for each other aren't as unrequited as you thought."
"Your eyelids flutter. “Hey.” You rasp, blood dribbling down your chin at the motion. Your body jerks limply, and a fountain of ruby red splashes onto Levi’s lap. He takes your hand, squeezes it tightly. You squeeze back with only a fraction of the force he knows you’re capable of. In a twisted turn of events, you, Levi’s lover, take the bullet instead. (Spoilers for Attack on Titan S4) Edit : Now with an alternative happy ending as per a Tumblr request, see Chapter 2!"
"Your eyelids flutter. “Hey.” You rasp, blood dribbling down your chin at the motion. Your body jerks limply, and a fountain of ruby red splashes onto Levi’s lap.

"“Commander!” Jean burst open the door of the office room of the Azumabito mansion at Marley, startling Hange, who was sitting by the main desk, poring over the country’s map. He looked like he had run a mile- his hair disheveled, panting heavily, with utter shock etched on his face. “We just received a letter addressed from Eren under the name of Kruger!” --- Hange dealing with Eren's betrayal, Sasha's death, and Levi's absence."
"'Every time, he solemnly forced his eyes shut and looked the other way'"
"Mikasa, holder of the Warhammer Titan, is sent to Paradis along with the rest of the Warrior Unit to carry out the Paradis Island Operation."
"Eren can no longer take it anymore"
"After so many deaths despair was running rampant. People use different ways to cope. Some isolate themselves, some try to make others happy, others beat themselves up, and some try and distract themselves from the pain. Eren and Jean find their own way to cope."
"Hit-for-hire Isabella Fleischer accepts a job to take down a Military Police soldier two years after Wall Maria falls, resulting in different events reacting and branching outwards. From a cynical lord with affiliations of the Underground human trafficking trade, to an untrusting, gambling-addicted commander of the least popular branch, and finally to a peculiar horror storybook character of an era gone, all paths inevitably will cross to reveal secrets that only those smart enough will survive. Consequences of her choices will slam Isabella, but a chance for her to avoid being hung will come from a friendship with a lonely soldier that never seems to clean their glasses."
"“I saw Mr Galliard’s memories last night.” Gabi’s mouth drops. Falco isn’t sure why he said that. Having lunch with Gabi is one of the only moments that he feels at peace these days, a break from all the thoughts he has when he’s on his own—but he can’t help it. It just slips. (OR: In which Falco and Gabi talk about the ones they've lost.) Falbi Week 2022 (Day 4) — Healing Together"
"In a world filled with disease and hatred, Eren will discover who he truly is and what he truly believes. With the plague running rampant in the streets, and his heart beating fast whenever he thinks of a certain knight, will his life ever be the same?"
"Growing up underground had taken everything from (Y/N) (L/N), his family, his friends, even the one he loved. It was necessary, to escape the abuse inflicted upon him by his father. But in the process of trying to find his path he’d lost everything, everything dear to him. With nothing more left to lose he joined the scouts. A decision that would once again re-ignite his lost spark. (A story about YOU in the AOT Universe)"
"After isolating in the worn-down town of nowhere, former artist, Zeke Jaeger finds himself captivated by the girl from the local art shop. Unable to distract himself enough to cast her from his mind, he takes extreme measures to satiate the intensity of his longing."
"Reiner Braun has a lot of regrets in life."
"This idea would not leave me alone until I wrote it down, so now I have decided I must curse you all with it as well, enjoy! :) When the Eldians hid behind the walls made by the first king, a clan that served the king came as well. But over time the clan became less and less useful as the walls protect them from titans. The king let them go, and as time passed their own culture had formed around ferociousness and repaying their debts. One day, the neighboring village tries to get them in their debt only to end up massacring the entire clan. Or they would have, if the Survey Corps wasn't in the right place at the right time. ~ The cadets from the 104th have a lot of questions about the eccentric, violent, and permanently dramatic soldier who follows around Erwin, Levi, and Hange. Updates on Sundays!"
"It's New Year's Eve and your best friend, Sasha, challenges you to complete a to-do-list of 22 sexual exploits as your New Year's resolution. You begin to make your way through the list, and eventually find your new roommate is more than happy to help you reach your goal..."
"Armin’s wild, fear-filled eyes were trained on him. His mouth open and moving, but Eren couldn’t hear a word of what was undoubtedly being screamed at him. The buzzing grew louder the closer the two got. But it wasn’t enough. Right when the incessant, overwhelming noise broke, Armin suddenly disappeared under the surface with a bone-chilling, gargled noise. Only a frantic stream of bubbles marked the area where Armin once was. --------- One seemingly harmless summer in Shiganshina, Eren's life turns upside down. After tragedy leaves the town reeling and the odds seem to be against Eren, it is up to him alone to figure out what was really happening."
"After living with your roommate, Levi, for a year now, you're in a predicament as to where your feelings lie."
"In which Techno ends up in the Attack on Titan universe, confuses a lot a people, kills a lot of titans, does a bunch of dumb shit, and would really just like a bowl of soup please. Levi is along for the ride. (I’m writing this on a very shitty impulse)"
"""If she doesn't get to live,"" He growled, ""No one does."""
"College. You throw that graduation cap high in the sky and say goodbye to the high school you’ve grown to know and love. The cheering sounds, covering up those loud sobs as you bid your friends goodbye one last time and split up; only bound to stay in touch for six months and then never talk again. Then you pick up your bags filled with clothes and other necessities and step out of your house. And like a baby bird, you fly out of your nest, and you soar to… College. Four years filled with self-discovery, love, heartbreak, sadness, anger, parties, drinking, auras of lust. And of course, although not much, learning. This is going to be so much fun for everyone! … Right?"
"And if Levi felt his body was a traitor before, now it was downright mutinous. Control over his body was his bread and butter, and that control was instinctual, basic, in his blood. Then why did his body stall when his mind was screaming at him to throw Eren off him and beat him senseless for his arrogant, presumptuous transgression? Why was he just lying there, letting this horny teenager rub up against him? His answer came in the form of a drawn-out, incredibly audacious moan against his neck, confirming what he had already begun to suspect. Eren was in a deep sleep. Fuck. Basically: Eren humps Levi in his sleep and Levi feels guilty about it... until he doesn’t."
"He cups her face, the palm of his hand cool against her warm cheek. He doesn’t say anything, but there’s a tenderness in his gaze, in his touch, that cuts through everything else, straight to the heart of it and to Historia’s need to be wanted"
"...His knife darted out to you, the pointed end pushing against your artery. You didn’t even want to breathe, or make any movements. You could only stare at his weapon at your neck with wide eyes. Fuck. “I said,” he spit out, and your eyes met his stony ones, “make any noise, and I’ll slice your throat.” You are a soldier in the Survey Corps, under Flagon’s leadership, and you and your squad have to adjust and juggle many changes.  However, you’re too perceptive for your own good, and your intuition is telling you something is wrong with the three new recruits.  As you spiral into an obsession in finding out what they were really up to, you find yourself in quite the dilemma. Set in the second POV,  and starts during ACWNR.  A slow burn enemies-to-lovers Levi x Female Reader fic that deals with obsession, rebuilding trust, overcoming family dynamics, mental health issues, and perseverance.   Will follow along canon storyline with slight divergence here and there."
"❝I'm a sinner so do what you please with me.❞ Levi Ackerman, the Vice President of the company, ""Scout Regiment"", has his eyes set on Hanji Zoe the moment he was hired. At first, his intentions were purely to sleep with her, to become friends with benefits. But what happens when he slowly starts to fall for her? That sleeping with her isn't enough anymore and wants to develop a relationship with her? Most importantly, how will Hanji react to it?"
"After a childhood greatly lacking affection, Armin is desperate for someone to love him and ready to give his heart and soul away at the first opportunity. One textbook abusive relationship later, Armin has pretty much stopped believing in the concept of happiness.  When being introduced to Eren Yeager, however, he can't help himself slowly falling for the rebellious metalhead, who seems to be a bit of an enigma but might be able to teach Armin how to trust and enjoy life again. Still - ex-partners don't just disappear and neither do the scars they caused. And no matter how perfect the idea of a relationship seems, some things you have to fight for on your own, like self-worth. Also, no one is perfect anyway and everyone has a past - especially Eren. But maybe it's worth it this time."
"After “Midnight Sun” Hange and Levi discuss his choice to save Armin."
"In which Reiner is depressed, Eren wants peace, and the events of season 4 never happened. This is a lot of self indulgent fluff wrapped in a sad blanket."
"- Being dead since the 19th century, your 200-year-old house in the countryside had been sold to Levi Ackerman. He stumbles upon your diary and reads it, only to slowly fall in love with you as he continues to flip the pages. Who would have known love could exist between two people separated not only by centuries, but also by death itself?"
"There are things that Jean knows for sure; what he is going to do is not one of them. All he knows is that things will not end like this."
"It’s February aka Love Month! Countdown to  Valentine’s Day, here is a compilation of 7 one-shots with Levi Ackerman revolving around different emotions and scenarios. Angst, fluff, regret, romance- all for the name of love! As AOT is about to end, I don't want to miss the last season writing for my favorite character especially Heart's Day!"
"Short story about Connies grief. //AOT SPOILERS//"
"“I’m no hero, Smith,” Levi bites back. “A hero would sacrifice the one person they love for the world, but me? I would burn the world down before I had to let you go. Everyone else can go to hell.” “My love,” Erwin reaches up to cup the curve of his cheek. “You can’t. I’ve made my choice.” “And you choose the mission.” “I choose you.” “Then don’t go,” Levi tries once again. He hates that his voice warbles. He hates that only Erwin can get him like this, crying like a lovesick fool in the wee hours of the night. “Please.” Or, Levi tries to convince Erwin not to go on the expedition."
"“You’re a faggot. You fuck men.” There is a silence. The fire cracks, the rain keeps pouring. And Uri chuckles, amused, not offended even the slightest. The deep tone sends shivers in Kenny’s being and he tenses. “If you get enough proof… You might get me beheaded,” he murmurs."
"A night out with your friends starts your semester off poorly. You can't remember much but from what you understand you made a fool of yourself in a crowded bar. You have to piece together the events of the night and what you find horrifies you."
"After the chaos, there is a hope for peace. But the new world is cruel to heroes. In a world where Muller's soldiers have gone rogue, and logic goes sour."
"“Hey, it’s okay. It was just a dream,” she carefully framed his face in her hands. Mikasa repeated these words again and again with her low soothing voice until he calmed down. “You are real, right? This is real, right?” he asked with obvious fear written on his face and agony in his trembling voice. Eren is trying to convince himself that the woman he’s looking at is not just a figment of his imagination. His hand reached for Mikasa, lightly brushing the lid of her droopy eye with his fingertips, then her petite nose, then her soft plump lips that curled into a small reassuring smile. “Of course. And I’m not going anywhere. I’m not gonna leave you.”"
"Mikasa gets frustrated with the nightmares she keeps getting from her past life. She leads a very frustrated life until she meets a certain someone from her past life. She tries reconnect with her roots where she finds the true meaning of her existance and the true meaning of her life. (There will be mentions of canon characters but their role isn't really important to the storyline) ⚠️I do not own the characters of attack on titan"
"Bertolt, Annie and Reiner have come to the island of Paradis with a mission; to retake the Founding Titan and save the world. Following their breach on Wall Maria, the three struggle with their actions, and with one of the three already disillusioned with their cause and another swiftly following her, will meeting and growing close to an island devil change their perspective of events? Can they afford to get attached when their mission demands they don't? Bertolt/OC, but before that blooms, Reiner/Bertolt may happen. More tags added as new chapters are released."
"You want casual sex, but Eren wants something more. Once you break it off, you later find out you're pregnant. You're so afraid of commitment, you keep it a secret from Eren for years. But he will prove to you that you won't be his future ex-wife."
"Hange..."
"He longed for it all: that obnoxious attitude; the explosive sneezes; the stench of sweat after a long day of training; how Eren always found it necessary to splash him when they bathed together. And the way he would sing ""Happy Birthday"" in the strangest voices."
"This is based off a dream that I had. Warning this may be cringey and not very well done as it is my first story. ~~~ What if there was not only Humanities Strongest? If Humanities Hope waltzed and looked at everyone as a new recruit then what would happen? What makes her Humanities Hope? Can hope truly exist in a dreary and dead world where everyone is at a loss of life. Living everyday for what? To what end where the walls break down for everyone and everyone can feel as though the weight of their sins are off their shoulders? Just how does hope come into play with the strongest who will survive and win a new life for everyone."
"Levi goes rigid, stopping completely, scenting the air.  “You’re an omega, monkey shit?” His voice has a quiver to it that confuses Zeke, as if the shorter man has to hold himself back. “Yes.” Zeke says like it’s not a big deal, because it hardly is. “And you didn’t think to say anything. Anything at all?” Levi says, grinding his teeth. Zeke shrugs. “Is that a problem to you, shortie?” “I can smell you going into heat, so yes it’s a fucking problem.” He hisses."
"Ymir laments leaving Historia, but gets some surprisingly deep answers from Annie, her only friend. One who's been through this all too much."
"""Tomorrow, they would get up, (Y/N) would pack her things, and they would pretend none of this had ever happened. They would each go to work, and when— not if, they too often worked too closely together for that— they saw each other in their discharge of their duties, then they would greet one another cordially and act as though they were nothing more than casual acquaintances. They had done it many times before, but now— now there was finality to the act that had not been present before. This was truly the last time they would be together like this."" This is a tale of Staff Sergeant Levi Ackerman and ADA!Reader, and how they desperately try to convince themselves and everyone else that they aren't in love (and, of course, they fail miserably) while trying to take down the biggest crime syndicate in Shiganshina: the Marley family."
"A decade is a long time to think about the choices you regret. It’s been ten years since Levi left New York City, and eight since Erwin last saw him. They never expected to be in each other’s lives again, but here they are - back in the city where they grew up and fell in love before they fell apart. Time has changed them both, for better and for worse. When they find each other again, are they clinging to the past, or can they love each other for who they are today? ------- This fic is dedicated to my friends, followers, and mutuals on TikTok who welcomed me into the Eruri community so sweetly in 2021. It has been a joy getting to know you all, and I would never have done this without your support and encouragement. This is a love letter to you as much as it is to our boys. And with that, all that is left for me to say is: enjoy!"

"Eren sees Mikasa as nothing but a stress reliever, but Mikasa sees Eren as more. As much as it kills her to keep up with it, as sick and dirty as it makes her feel, she does it anyway because she loves him. She always has. If it keeps him happy, she will be his Whore."

Levi is a very… intense LA teacher… what happens when Eren gets a panic attack when in detention with Levi? ""I did as he asked. He growled and grabbed the back of my neck, forcing me to stay, my face tightly pressed against his pubic hair. I choked on his dick, struggling for breath once more. I couldn’t breathe as he grinded against my face. I turned my face to the side, fighting for a single breath. He sighed regretfully, and slapped my face, hard.

"(Takes place after chapter 90.) It's been a year since the majority of the survey corp were wiped out in Shiganshina. A year since Levi used the injection to save Armin and Commander Erwin died. A year since the survey corp reached the basement and learned the secrets of the titans. Now they've finally reached the ocean. Despite the celebration, a sobering truth hangs above them: many people have died to get them this far. Night comes and the survey corp camps outside the walls for the first time. While everyone sleeps, Levi notices Hanji sitting by the ocean deep in thought. He approaches her, and Hanji and Levi have the heart-to-heart that they have evaded since the injection on the roof. A surprising guest interrupts their conversation."
"Reiner and Bertholdt were too young be war machines. Too young to have shed bucketfuls of blood. Too young to be on their own in a strange land. Too young to be housed in a kind woman's home, hands roaming all over each other’s bodies while Annie slept just feet away. But when doomed to short lives and the heaviest weights upon their shoulders, why did it matter how fast they grew up? They stopped being children the day guns were placed in their small hands."
"A kingdom fresh out of war sees the return of its soldiers and its crown Prince, which while good for the Kingdom, is bad for the criminal underworld, or more specifically...Bertholdt. The increase in security means eating will get trickier, after all. Bertholdt didn't think life could get much worse. Of course, he had a tendency to be proven wrong."

"Eren is a relatively unknown prodigy figure skater going out for his first-ever Olympics. His chosen event is pairs, and he's even more nervous than a normal nineteen-year-old would be. Eren's part of a controversial plot that will take the Olympic world by storm. Levi is a famous professional skater. He's won silver at his past two Olympics, and this one will be his last chance for the coveted gold. When his old friend Hanji calls in a debt, Levi has no choice but to suck it up, throw on a leotard, and go out with a bang."
"They were not simple folk, you see, though they were happy. But we do not say the words of cheer much any more. All smiles have become archaic. Given a description such as this one tends to make certain assumptions. Given a description such as this one tends to look next for the King, mounted on a splendid stallion and surrounded by his noble knights, or perhaps in a golden litter borne by great-muscled slaves. But there was no king. They did not use swords, or keep slaves. They were not barbarians. In a town filled with happiness, where nothing was lacking and sadness was a construct only found scrawled into dusty tomes, Eren Jaeger was born and lived and grew up. It was an enviable life, a good and wholesome life. And then, when he was twelve, everything changed."
"Levi has felt numb since the rooftop. Did he make the right choice?"
"He scratches my chest as he grapples with the front of my collar. “Eren, are you giving up?” I take a hold of his wrist and wrench his hand from my shirt. “Don’t you remember what I said from our first conversation…” I stand with a new fire now boiling within my gut and hover my hand before my mouth. “I’ll kill them all.”"
"In the safety of the trees, Eren won't stop struggling. Reiner gets carried away in an attempt to shut him up, and things quickly spiral out of control. [ch. 46, reiner/eren, thoroughly unpleasant]"
"[DA Request #2]  Another request from a wonderful person on DeviantArt. The prompt was for an angst fic with Erwin and the reader. Hopefully this is angsty enough, in contrast to my super fluffy Marco fic :)"
"Reiner is home. Everything seems to be where it belogs, except nothing is right."
"There's only so much Levi is willing to do for his fellow soldiers, especially when it comes to things that haunt all of them; like nightmares. But Erwin is the exception to everything. For Erwin, he would do anything, just to heal his pain."
"“I want you to know before we go, I'm not someone you will want a relationship with.  I can give you tonight, but if you are looking for something deeper, I’m not the man you will want.”  Levi seemed to think about Erwin's confession for a moment. “Got it.  Hot as hell sex, but no marriage proposal.  I think I’ll survive.”"
"After the battle to take back Trost from titans, there is something happening."
"Wohlan Freund! Jetzt hier ist dein sieg! Dies ist der erste... Marco stared at his dull reflection in the mirror. At the bent, distorted flesh that had once been his face. He might have reached up to touch it, if he'd still had a right arm. He considered the knife in his left hand. He felt tears at the back of his eyes when he considered the life-long ache in his hip, his inability to take a deep breath, and the monster that stared back out of the mirror. His voce dropped to a choked, ironic whisper. ""Gloria."""
"Based from a prompt: Levi decided to do something stupid, however, Erwin did not find it as a good idea. Levi Ackerman lost nearly everyone in his life. His mother, his ex-girlfriend, Farlan and Isabel, those people who he wished they never died. The man doesn't look forward to his future afterwards until there was only one person whom he almost forgotten before risking his life."
"Day 6: ABO/omegaverse AU Levi was told at a young age that he would never have children. After believing he would never have what he wanted, Eren refuses to let that become true. *This may be uncomfortable to some as Levi is infertile/cannot have children, causing him to be self-critical of himself and his relationship with Eren. Please read the notes at the beginning."
"""And it was love at first sight, at least on my end."" He rolled his eyes. ""You're so cheesy."" ""Only for you."" (Rated T+ for language)"
"There's a stark contrast between living within the walls and living without them, and it takes Levi a while of living on his own without them to figure out exactly what it is that he wants out life and his new found freedom. It takes him a while to figure out that it's Erwin that he wants."
"The third time Eren whimpers against Levi's throat, he's pinned underneath his commanding officer, wrists numb but bones unbroken. He shudders, shatters, dragging out hiccups until they shake his entire body. Levi's brows crease and he sets his head gently on Eren's chest. His fingers rub soothing circles on Eren's wrists, on Eren's palms, on Eren's arms, and he listens to him whimpering. Levi knows what he should do, but he's not entirely sure what he wants to do."
"""Sometimes when there is too much to focus on, focusing at all becomes too hard. A seemingly normal facade can hide something a lot more complicated. Everything feels blurred and a simple thought turns into a storm of ideas. Perfect grades and perfect lives can’t make up for everything in life. Affection can turn into pain and obsession."" Armins life is seemingly perfect, at least from the outside. He lives with both his parents in a nice neighborhood. His grades for his senior year are perfect. Him and all his friends are getting ready to leave for the same college come autumn. This doesn't stop Him from the constant feeling of being lonely, which leads to confused feelings."
"While Reiner dissociates from himself to bear his burden, Bertholdt finds his own escape in books. And he wishes more than anything the stories were a reality."
"I won't miss this world, but I'll always continue to miss you."
"THIS IS PART 2 - PLEASE SEE ""http://archiveofourown.org/works/10520289/chapters/23221770"" for the first part. Probably a very badly written sequel."
"Deciding to help Connie Springer may have been the worst decision of his life. Armin is blackmailed into sleeping with his instructor, with disastrous consequences. Note: this is labelled a Gen story for a reason. The focus is on the psychological problems and after-effects, not on any relationship."
"Based of a doujin by P:id=1947576. ‘Out of all the possibilities he envisioned their first meeting, he never imagined this.’"
"Years after the war’s conclusion, Levi opens a tea shop in a neat little town where he and Eren can find the respite they’ve been fighting so hard for. But for Eren, the process of recovery has slowed to nothing. Is the love of a man who formerly held the title of Humanity’s Strongest enough to soothe this aching boy’s soul?"
"When recovery turns into an all-out angst parade and then into a sickening threesome, awkward and unhappy (and rated M for reasons), it's nothing but sheer humiliation in the end. Really, what else could that be? One-sided: Annie x Reiner, Reiner x Christa. However Bertholdt x Annie - might not be as one-sided. In author's wishful thinking. Enjoy at your own risk."
"Ever since your youths, the two of you have been quite the pair: the toddler son of a prostitute and the child-thief who protected him; a thug who could waltz and a whore who could kill; humanity’s strongest soldier and an officer’s mistress. And now, after years of separation: diamond and dust."

It could be days or weeks or months. So much has happened that Levi’s lost track of time. All that mattered was surviving.  And somehow they have.  Somehow, against all the odds, they are both still alive. Levi and Erwin re-unite after the Uprising."
"He didn’t want to go back to his apartment, to his empty bed, and feel that same gut-wrenching loneliness that had been eating away at him for weeks. Levi was nice. Levi wanted him. Levi would take care of him for the night."
"Hange knew that if she was more alert, she would have seen Bertholdt coming in. She knew that she could have warned everyone to take cover. They would have been safe."
"None"
"Levi reminisces the times when the war was still occurring as he walks to the beach for lunch with the love of his life."
"Unable to deal with their horrific memories, Mikasa and Jean discover an unconventional way to cope."

"In the town of Trost, there lies two men who are worthy enough to be known as gods in the culinary field. Both are renowned graduates  from the 104th class under Sasha, the potato queen, at the Survey Corps Academy. But, one town can't have two esteemed establishments. With their future businesses on the line, Jean and Armin are determined to duke it out in one final battle of the chefs. The winner takes whatever he desires."
"He hadn't meant to hurt anyone. Call it the Curse of the Werecat, but blood gets spilled when a loved one is imperiled, regardless of whether that's what's desired at the moment. Of course, Armin was used to protecting Eren in such a manner... ... But why, this time, did he do the same for Farlan?"
"Eren, Mikasa, and Levi are sent deep undercover into Marley where Mikasa and Levi have to charade as a couple to keep their identities hidden."
"Story idea inspired by the song Rockabye by Clean Bandit."
"The string of fate is just as likely to wrap around someones neck as easily as their finger. Or The one where Jean is his. No, that's not right. Jean only becomes his after Marco dies. Because Jean- in his purest form- is Marco's. It's only grief that makes him Eren's."
"The mountains have been a secluded area from humans for many eons. The presence of a dragon kept even the most avid adventurers at bay. But that never stopped Eren. But when the townspeople are fed up with greed for new lands, Eren has no choice but to warn his friend of his approaching death. But will the ancient dragon heed the young human's words or accept his fate to leave the world?"
"Written for Zed as part of a collab she graciously asked me to do with her. I love you, darling.  She gave me the first few lines, a sneak peak of her art, and the premise, and I ran wild. HERE IS THE ART , oh dear god I'm a puddle. Erwin still sees Levi sometimes, at night when he can't tell if he's dreaming or haunted.  He doesn't care either way and he doesn't want morning to come."
"Levi can't understand Eren's choice. One last time he try to convince him to stay and fight for his life. But will Eren listen ?"

"It's been many years since the Titans were defeated. With everyone leaving to live out the rest of their lives, Eren was lost. His only goal was to eradicate all titans, yet now that they were gone, he had no purpose. Alone, he set out on a journey to find a new start. Away from those who already forgot the past, away from the conviction of those gone, away from the harboring guilt of those living a lie. However, he never expected to meet a certain soldier when he went back to the old castle."
"When Armin shuts his eyes to avoid watching Jean being humiliatingly punished in front of the 104th, Levi decides to take both of them down to the dungeons and reveal the worst of everyone. EDIT: Decided to add a new chapter! (this work is explicit throughout, with emphasis on Levi/Jean in the first two chapters, shifting to Armin/Jean in 3 and 4, with a bit of both in 5.)"
"Erwin's death hurts Levi. Until it doesn't have to."
"Erwin is the sun—warm, bright, and beautiful—and Levi is anything but. A man like Erwin isn't meant to be with someone like him, and he knew that. The sun shines on all the flowers, but the flowers only know one sun."
"Short, poetic line of thoughts. Eren's POV."
"♞ 'Ethics play no part in politics' ~ Machiavelli, The Prince Erwin Smith doesn't believe in legends. Whispers of witches and evil are merely the sayings of those below him. But, when he is graced by a prophecy, he cannot help but burn with ambition.

Inspired by Macbeth by Shakespeare ♞"

With the only break from experimentations and torment is a friendly nurse, who can see past his monstrous abilities and promises to help him escape, he can only hold onto a slither of hope that his pain will end soon.

Who think we have a future here,” Christopher said. “Just because they haven’t been invaded in one hundred years,” he said quietly, “Doesn’t mean there isn’t the possibility that they’ll be breached today, or tomorrow, or the next day. It’s inevitable.” There was silence before it all changed. Looking back on it, one would wonder how to describe it. Perhaps the silence before an explosion. There was a bolt like orange lightning beyond the wall off in the distance, an explosion in which sparks of ember and clouds of smoke rose from it, and an ear piercing sound that brought on loud ringing in their ears. The ground shook so much it threw all three boys off of where they sat and to the ground, and they landed roughly on the hard Earth running along the canal. Alastair nearly fell in. They stood shakily. “What the hell was that?” Alastair asked. Christopher stood, looking through an alleyway in between two houses where people rose from the ground and started walking towards the sound to investigate. ------ Also known as The Last Hours Attack on Titan AU."
"“Please, just a little more,” Ymir begs, and Reiner must feel an immense, insurmountable amount of guilt because he begrudgingly acquiesces, loosening his hold on her elbow slightly if only to let her finish writing. Truth is, I do have one. “Come on,” Reiner grinds through clenched teeth. It’s a toll on his soul that he’s the one tasked with taking her to the stand. But this time he doesn’t loosen his grip, the sting of his painful hold on her arm burning through her clothed flesh. Ymir keeps writing, frantic. It’s that I never got to marry you."

"“I forgive you,” said she. Her eyes, expressionless. Her hands, motionless. Her mouth, shut. Her whole form was void of emotion. He felt petrified at the sight. Eren and Mikasa were married, had a beautiful home, a family. Their son was six, their daughter was eight, their dog was seven, and their cats were ten.

"The seventh part to ""You Deserve the World,"" about Marleyan Erwin and Levi (and Marley Erwin's backstory). “He spit at you,” his superior noted, “Now what are you going to do about it?” Erwin didn’t blame the man for spitting on him.

You want to be disciplined too?” his superior threatened, putting a hand to his belt buckle threateningly. Erwin’s eyes widened slightly, and on quick reflex, he smacked the shit out of the small Eldian, growling, “How dare you spit on me, you scum.”"

And I’m going to bring you back to Paradis so you can endure the worst torture of your life.” Erwin looked down to the ground, his shoulders shaking. Levi was confused at first, until he realized the man was cackling evilly. Levi frowned, knowing that wasn’t a good sign. Why had the man laughed like that? Levi drew his blade and put it up to Marley Erwin’s neck, ordering, “Tell me what the fuck you’re laughing about, you psycho.” Erwin grinned down at Levi, “If that’s true, then your Erwin is dead by now.”"

She can tell from the quirk of Levi’s eyebrow that he thinks that’s bullshit. “He’s just going through a phase,” she adds, with a wave of her hand. “Well, it’s a shitty phase so I hope he gets over it soon,” Levi says, wiping his hands on the apron Mikasa and Eren got him last year for his birthday. “And if anything was going on, you’d tell me, right?” He gives her a long lingering look whose scrutiny adheres to Mikasa’s skin like cling wrap, sticking to all the places where she’s gone wrong. “Of course,” she lies."

"Mike and Erwin share a moment after the 57th Expedition"
"Levi moaned lewdly, back arching into each savage thrust of the blonde’s hips. Mouth open wide as he panted heavily, rocking backwards so he met Erwin's hips roughly. He wanted it to hurt. Wanted Erwin to dig his fingers into his hips, wanted to have the marks and bruises for weeks, so that everyone knew that he was the commanders, that the blonde owned him."

The cold of the stone stings on her clothed thigh, and it’s one of many things that’s overwhelming her right now. I’m so sorry, she thinks. I’m sorry, I know how it feels, I know what happened, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. “I see,” is what she says instead, gulping. There's a manic look in her eyes, she knows. Hopefully it distracts the others from the growing hollowness in her chest vacuuming her body like a black-hole. I think I know what happened, she cries in her head, the voice nagging and desperate for attention. I know what happened and there’s nothing we can do, I’m so sorry, your mother is as good as dead. Stuck in a nightmare, forever."
"Day 1 of Zevi week prompt: Forest/Healing Levi glares at him and Zeke feels like he is picturing his head on his blade. His tongue feels heavy in his mouth and his blood icy in his veins. Probably not the smartest move to piss off the tiny serial killer. “Listen beardie, do not fucking speak to me unless I speak to you first. Got it?” Levi says. His voice and face are neutral but his words cause a shive to go down Zeke’s spine. “Did you just call me beardie?” Zeke asks, even though he was literally just explicitly told not to talk. “Because that almost sounds like a pet name.”"

"Zevi Week Day 7 Prompt: To die in your arms “Do you think I’ll hurt? When the bomb drops.” Levi says. Zeke looks sad, knowing back when he was in the Marleyan army he dropped his fair share of bombs and artillery weapons on unsuspecting people. “I don’t know.” He says, honestly. “I really wish I did.” Levi nods. “Yeah. I suppose it won’t be that bad as long as I have you with me.” It was very, very uncommon for Levi to be so poetically romantic. Zeke turns bright red and crushes Levi to his broad chest."

Now, Elide is left with only two choices; join the Scout Regiment as punishment for her crimes, or face execution for her and all of her followers.

'Levi never ceased to believe that fate had a spiteful vendetta against him. For he is no more than a devil, existing individually in his hell and knowing nothing more, as it is only natural. In spite of that, he had been brought an angel - disguised as a man with sapphire eyes and an unattainable goal. The same goal that leaves him here now, a fallen angel, despite being God's most beloved.'"

"He knew rain. It’s when water trickled down and the streets were thick with mud. When people got stuck under landslides and suffocated to death; choking on dirty viscous earth. When the pipes got clogged and the smell of sewage was so bad you puked. He knew rain. He started tying grass together as a distraction. Each knot broke the skin of the blades, water oozing and itchy. But it was routine; rip, cross, over, around, and pull; rip, cross, over, around, and pull; drip, cross, drip, around, and drip. There were droplets first, they fell in his hair. There was no pattern just the occasional soft plunk. Then he saw it, coming up over the walls, across the flat, flat land, up onto his hill; carving out a trail. It was a solid mass of storm. He let it soak him. **** Or: The long laborious love chart of Erwin and Levi. A post ACWNR fic. 6/24/22: Temporary Hiatus. I will be back, just dealing with college stuff."

"Hange felt their chest ache at the sight before them. Levi in a trussed, bloody heap in the mud. They moved towards him and dropped to their knees, ignoring the wetness that seeped into their clothes, and dirtied their trousers. Hange steeled themselves and reached out, pulling Levi’s small frame into their arms gently. All the blood drained out of their face as they let out an audible gasp."
"Three-shot / three drabbles of the title pairs belonging to NARUTO, Shingeki no Kyojin and Berserk."

"The warmth encircling his hand was more comforting than it had any right to be, and Levi let Hange linger there. He could only imagine what she had gone through, dragging his unconscious ass through a river while being chased by brainless idiots."
"“Erwin knelt down next to Levi and put a gentle hand on his shoulder. “Levi,” He said softly, and Levi’s grey eyes flashed open and he immediately sat up and socked Erwin in the face. “You bastard! This is all your fault, I’ll kill you!” He screamed, and the whole tent stared at him. Erwin was slightly stunned, but recovered from the strike and pinned Levi to the ground. “Levi! Get ahold of yourself, look around you!” He demanded, and he watched the Levi he knew slowly return behind those eyes. He was panting, his skin was sticky, and Erwin could feel him trembling underneath his hands. He sat back as Levi came back to himself. Levi saw the prying eyes of his squad stare him down and just knew he had made a scene of himself with his stupid fucking nightmares. “Fuck…” He breathed, closing his eyes, and then he stood up and left the tent, left his squad wondering about what the hell had just happened. Erwin followed him.” Levi acts composed in front of everyone during the day, but at night his past haunts him and causes him to act out and hurt the people he loves."

"There were many stories and legends recounted to Mikasa before bedtime, but one in particular stands out: in the high mountains of Hizuru, there is a river with the power to wash away a person’s memories. Legends say that once someone goes near the river, the water calls out to you in a gentle, alluring voice. It tugs you closer and closer, lulling you with its sweetness and beauty. The pull overtakes you until you’re not even conscious of your being. Instead, all you desire to do is to jump into its depths and forget everything . The reason why Mikasa remembered this story more than others is because Mikasa was undeniably happy with her peaceful life. And she couldn’t imagine anything changing that to warrant the desire to forget everything that defined her. ---- In which Mikasa is the princess of Hizuru and Eren is the youngest prince of the Eldian Empire."

The man held your shoulders tighter, almost to the point to hurt you. Those eyes shining with tears stopped any protest from being uttered. ""So, no matter what, pass on this power to someone."" It was funny how as the world crumbled, as you lost everything in a blink, you noticed the most meaningless things. Like that annoying smell inside the Titan nape you never got used to or the sky turning grey with all that steam around you. Or maybe it was because all colors had faded out from this earth?"

The boy in his dreams is always bleeding. His hands are puckers of scar tissue and bruises, never fully healed before he tears them apart again. The boy in his dreams is a ghost inside of a seashell. His voice ricochets like bullets, raining blood over the upturned faces of angels. The boy in his dreams fades by morning, and sometimes, when Armin wakes up, he is already crying."
"Erwin finds his pleasure in those moments, although his natural disposition is one of commanding and being obeyed. At the end of the day, Erwin is one of the most powerful men in the walls. It is no secret, and Erwin would be remiss to say he doesn’t flex it on occasion. The fact of the matter is this: Erwin makes the calls, and Levi does obey. Erwin could speculate on why for months or years, probably. He has some ideas–theories of blood and vows that can’t be broken–but the obedience is constant and unshakable, and that is all that really matters."
"What do these people know about war? What do these people know about the fear the war siren tears the heart with? What do they know about death? What do they think is in a war field?

"Doctor Jäeger dips into a supply closet, and Levi follows wordlessly. The doctor flips Levi, presses him against the door and grinds his hard, thick cock on the seam of his ass immediately after the door closes. He ruts against him, his white coat rustling with his jerking movements. “You have no idea how happy I am to see you, my little nurse.” The young doctor practically growls in Levi's ear. “It took you long enough to come back.” Levi bangs his forehead against the door. “I’m saying this as a person, I fucking hate you. As your subordinate that ultimately reports to you, go fuck yourself.” Doctor Jäeger laughs in his ear, making Levi grit his teeth. “Oh, you still have such a filthy fucking mouth on you, Nurse Ackerman.” He continues rutting against the seam of Levi’s ass through his scrubs. Levi turns his head to see the doctor pull out a condom and lube from his coat."
"Ymir has a horrible past and Historia comforts her"
"Floch awoke, high off coke, tripping out of his mind. He stumbled out of his bed and down the stairs. His stumble became a trip and he began to roll down the stairs, bashing his head against each step as he went. Seconds passed, and then the seconds turned into minutes. How many fucking stairs did he have, he thought to himself, as he felt his skull bash open against the last step."
"“Mikasa, take some deep breaths,” he instructed, “There’s no reason to be so angry.” “You’re treating me like a child!” Mikasa argued, going over to her bed and sitting down on it as she crossed her arms. You are a child, he thought to himself, but refrained from saying it out loud. He knew that wouldn’t get them anywhere, and the teen would be far angrier with him if he told her that she was a child. “Mikasa,” Erwin tried, “I’m not letting you sleepover at your boyfriend’s place. What kind of parent would I be if I encouraged something like that?”"
"As soon as they met Levi was infatuated with Eren's emerald eyes, but even he didn't know how quickly he would need to rely on the brat.

One day, he's introduced to a boy named Eren, and he feels compelled to get closer to the boy. As Armin struggles with his relationship and fights his feelings for the brunette, what started as a few occasional hangouts, slowly turns into a tangle of love, lust, and heartbreak. His romance with Eren was one he knew was ephemeral, but he'd already fallen, and it was far too late to back out."
"“Let go of me, Levi.” Eren whispered with a wavering voice, eyes shining with desire. While Eren was so good at getting what he wanted, he was so fucking shitty at hiding it. “I’m going to Mikasa’s. Let go of me.” Levi dragged his hand towards Eren’s nape, playing with the short strands of hair that tickled the skin there. He watched as Eren’s lashes flickered closed and let him bask in the comfort of a gentle touch for just a second before entangling his fingers into the locks behind his head and pulling. Levi was addicted to a lot of things. Eren was one of them."
"Pieck celebrates Valentine’s Day with Hange"
"The two of them had always been close, even now, when they were a mass of stone walls and iron bars apart. They cried for one another at night, they heard each other's screams, they whimpered their names to themselves when they drifted off to sleep. It wasn't for any ulterior purpose, no partner in crime sort of behavior. It was different, intimate almost.

So he will call them to Ymir’s playground because he has to set them straight but also because he wants them to hear his voice.

"Levi instantly ducked his right arm under Erwin’s, brushing it away with a harsh swat. Flinching as if burned, eyes blown wide open. Erwin grimaced. “Don’t fuckin’ touch me, ya’ filthy pig. We’re not buddies,” the raven snapped lowly, accent flowing thickly. Grey glazed over with fury. His eyes pinched in along with his eyebrows. “Don’t ya’ forget what ya’ fuckin’ did. I still hate ya’ guts, Smith. Just because I decided to follow ya’ doesn’t mean I particularly like ya’, ya’ hear?” … Recovering from the deaths of his family, Levi seeks condolence. He gets it in the form of Erwin Smith. (Post-ACWNR, After Isabel and Farlan’s death.)"
"“Mikasa.” There’s a mix of fear and revulsion in Levi’s eyes that makes her take a step back the way anger or scorn in them would not. “They are not going to give you that procedure. They are going to lock you into a room until you give birth, and they are going to take... it away, and they won’t care if it has twelve fingers or three eyes or the intelligence of a sponge, and they will raise it to be a weapon against humanity.

"The second that Eren had permission to, they all but ran to their room. It had been hours since they weren’t under the watchful eye of someone. They stopped at the door of their room, hesitating, and corrected their thoughts. It wasn’t their room; it was merely a room in the basement that they had no choice but to stay in. It was optimally positioned that were they to lose control, the Levi squad could easily subdue them. It was merely a tactically advantageous place for them to rest and have a little privacy. Privacy that was feigned at that. The door didn’t even lock, so that during the night they could check that they hadn’t fled or was ‘attempting communication with the enemy’, whatever that meant. Opening the heavy door, they slipped inside and breathed for the first time since they had touched the spoon and exploded into Titan form."

I hope I’m able to tell who you are so I can come and see how stunning you look, we can have some drinks as well.” They said with a wink. I grinned widely. In the end I found a handsome man instead of those drinks, If only it wasn't a masquerade ball so I could've seen his face, I recognized him slightly but from where... He would've had to be in my school because it's the schools ball but I swear I've never seen him... The next day I woke up to him in a bed, and his mask was off... No way wait. It's... LEVI?!

"“See you.” “See you,” Levi responded. That had been their farewell, they could never tie each other down with the word ‘love.’ It didn’t seem right to say it in a world like this because they never knew what could happen a few hours from now, tomorrow, or even a year. Yet, Levi had hoped to hear those words someday."
"Pieck and Jean have both lost someone extremely special to them. Now that things have settled, it's about time they tackle those feelings and move on..."
"There were no choices for Mikasa, there was only Eren, and his will. There was only him. There would only ever be him. It was selfish, his reasoning, he could admit that. He would always be selfish with her, would always take and take and take, would always keep her tethered, would never allow anyone else to get close to what he had of her, would never let her give what she gave to him to anyone else. Distantly, it’s all he ever wanted, the only thing he craved besides freedom, and he wanted it bad. He wanted to hear her choose him, again, wanted her to look past his sins, past right and wrong, just to be with him a little longer. — Mikasa visits Eren in his cell after Liberio, attempting to understand.

"“Damnit-” Erwin mumbled under his breath as the tie on his thoroughly bandaged hand became loose, starchy cotton tendrils hanging down to his wrist. He held it up to his lips and pulled at the bandage with his teeth and his spare hand. Levi desperately didn’t want to help but he couldn’t just stand by while someone did something like this. He didn’t let Erwin live for him to be killed by an infected wound a month later, “You’re disgusting.” He pulled the wrapped hand away from Erwin’s surprised face, resulting in his teeth clicking together on contact. Pulling the bandage tight again, he re-tied the gauze with quick precision of nimble fingers and then wiped his hands dramatically on his trousers, “That’s going to scar.” “Thanks”, Erwin mouthed after inspecting the knot and Levi merely shrugged, both of them seemingly forgetting that Levi was the cause of the offending bandage in the first place.

"Eren dreams of Titans. He dreams of flying, fighting, of sorrow living in his bones. He dreams of pain and death and blood, so much blood. He dreams of failure and stained hands, of success and silent tears. He dreams of anger and bloodlust, of devotion and love. When Eren dreams, it's of freedom. Or the one where Eren is reincarnated and dreams every night of another life."
"Eren goes back to his hometown for summer break, a small and quiet village that hasn’t changed since the brunet moved there to live with his grandma as a child. However, a surprise awaits him this time: a new librarian now works in the place he likes the most in the village, and love will finally enter his life."
"She sees him watching, and every time their eyes meet, hers light up a little bit, and she gives him the tiniest of smiles. Every time. That’s when he has to look away."
"Jean hasn't had anyone to call his own for a very long time. His life has been full of empty, meaningless relationships and faces all as replaceable as the last. He just can't help it. People aren't his ""thing"" and haven't been for years. Then one day, Marco Bodt steps in, and practically shoves him into the world. Jean's not quite sure, but inside that hollow chest of his, he might have felt something flutter. In which Jean has night terrors, and Marco likes cheesecake"
"Levi disobeys a direct command from Erwin only twice in his life. The first time it happens on the battlefield, the second as he watches Erwin standing at the gallows, a noose around his neck."
"This story is a flashback first-time story of how Levi took Eren as his pet. It is part of the blog bdsmfordummies-with-erwin-smith.tumblr.com and is in response to a follower Asking about how they got together. In this story, Levi is in a D/s relationship with Erwin Smith, but the Commander has told his boy he thinks Levi is a switch and should look for a pet of his own, because Erwin wants Levi to be happy and fulfilled and to be operating at maximum effectiveness and to do that, he needs an outlet for his aggressive, dominant side. This story takes place immediately after Levi kicks the crap out of Eren in front of the Military Tribunal in order to convince them to turn him over to the Survey Corps. They don't trust Eren yet, or know what kind of a threat he may be. In this anime, Levi does keep Eren chained up in a cell in the basement while he tries to decide if he's a monster or not. In this story, how he comes to that decision is a little more interesting than sitting around watching him and cursing at him from time to time. They haven't totally realized that Eren has to harm HIMSELF to shift, so Levi decides to conduct a brutal experiment that ends up having an unexpected result. And everything changes."
"Kenny wasn't exactly the best at taking care of others, but with the absence of Levi's father, teaching the runt to drive didn't seem like such a hard task. That's what everyone thought. It wasn't until Levi woke up did he realize he wanted to punch his uncle for being both a blessing and a curse. The next realization he had was he'd come face to face with an angel."
"Erwin would always tell Levi about his phantom pains, how he would feel sudden pain where the rest of his arm was missing."
"So I wrote the original version like 5 years ago, but recently I was going through my old drive and found it and fell in love with it again. so I rewrote the entire thing and here you go!"
"Eren has had a rough childhood, from his mom dying at a young age to a father who treats him as if he doesn't exist. He had to find a way to survive, and that way was to sell himself to the other boys at high school. Then he gets a break. As suggested one of his regulars, Jean Kirstein, he tries out becoming a professional in an omega bar. It was only meant as a joke when it left the horse faced boys lips, but to everyone's surprise, Eren is a prodigy in the area. He soon has a job at a local club and his life finally has started to take a turn for the better. Then Levi walks, literally, into his life and things get unnecessarily complicated for the young adult."
"It's the first Paradisan Eldian expedition back to the mainland and things are . . . weird, between the young members of Squad Levi. Much to Jean's confusion, his ex-lover Armin, who has been giving him the cold shoulder for years after ending their brief but intense relationship, begins flirting with him once they set foot in Marley. Or is that Jean's desperate imagination? Drunkenly confronting Armin at a party (started by the perpetually broody Eren, of all people), Jean may get more than he bargained for . . . My interpretation of and additions to the November 2019 chapter of SnK, chapter 123. This story takes place in the same universe as my Jearmin Week 2019 fic, A Life Within Walls."
"(I'm reposting my fics after they were deleted.) After so long of being treated like prisoners as well as outcasts, Eren wants his family to finally break free from oppression and flee to a great, wide world that awaits them. Yet on their way he and Levi must realize there are things they cannot protect their children from. This is the sequel to ""Just Mpreg Things""!! It continues right where we left off~"
"Holy fuck, Eren could not believe that be was at finally at No Name's concert, for the very first time, and that L was standing close in front of him, in the flesh. Well, as close as his poor fanboy ass could possibly be at his what-was-considered cheap (which, let's admit it here, was fucking expensive to him considering his shitty university pocket money, and the amount he'd just spent could last him many months worth of cheap disgusting cafeteria food) seat next to Armin, who was also geeking out just as much as him. Okay, maybe just a little less than him."
"Eren chases after Levi fruitlessly for four years, and Levi doesn't recognize his own feelings until every living creature on the planet is hitting on Eren. Then, they're happy together. Their relationship begins in high school, and it never technically ends. Levi just never got the chance to say goodbye."
"Sina Psychiatric Hospital is where Armin Arlert has dwelled for quite some time. While he’s been known for being the odd one of the so called freaks of ward 12, he believes he’s fine with his only friend Eren, whom he has a deep relationship with. When a newcomer called Levi is admitted to the same ward as him, and in fact the same room, he causes Armin to constantly question himself and his small, dark life."

"For the past ten or so months, you'd been a member of the Scout Regiment, and for three of those months you'd been a member of Squad Mike. The only issue in regards to your position that you could find as of late, was that you'd noticed you had a minor attraction to your Squad Leader. An attraction that was steadily beginning to make you feel flustered everytime he so much as looked or spoke to you. There was really no other way of putting it: You fancied the pants off of Section Commander Mike Zacharias. Title inspired by the song ""I Can't Help Falling In Love With You"" by Elvis Presley"
"Eren Jaeger, a college student at Shiganshima University, collapsed (literally) into Levi's life. When a small mishap during Levi's lunch break submerged him into something he could never believe. Could one of Trost Hospital's most hardass doctors and a dying brat really hit it off or will fate tear them apart?"
"eren is a prodigious savant. the most intelligent and sly detective from the LAPD, the only thing against him was his mental disability that made him an easily overwhelmed individual, hence his partner, hange zoë levi was a messed up teen driven to insanity that killed people for the fun of it. he dressed up in a revealing manner so he could attract his victims. these two personalities mixed up is something new, but will eren be able to complete his mission?"

Meanwhile, Eren Jaeger is shitty teenager, who took to selling his body in attempts to gain some extra cash in hope to get his own place, but situations like that always end up backfiring. When the two meet in the parking lot of Starbucks, problems happen."
"You met him in the streets of underground and became his shadow ever since."
"A collection on one-shots written for Winmin Week 2014. Mostly canonverse. 01. Superior and Subordinate: Armin was conflicted. They were superior and subordinate after all, kept apart by rules and regulations and just plain common sense. But the heart wants what it wants, and it wasn't like there was much else that made Eren smile lately. 02. Stained Hands: Armin wasn't trying to wash away the blood with ink. 03.

"Eren Yeager has finally gotten what he’s always wanted. He’s finished his training and has officially been named a member of the Scout Regiment. He’s admired these brave soldiers that could go beyond the wall his entire life and through them, he may finally be able to seek vengeance for his parents’ deaths. And then he meets Captain Levi Ackerman, a hard man with obscene fighting prowess. Once his idol and now a constant source of annoyance, Levi forces Eren to prove his place among the scouts and eventually ropes him in for an adventure he’d never even dreamt of. A/N I’m literally AWFUL at summaries. I promise it’ll be better than I made it sound."

"Mikasa Ackerman is running away from her past. She moves to Manhattan in the hopes of escaping, running a small bookstore. There, she meets Levi, a stoic but capable man, a man with a dark past of his own. As she tried to move on, the things she sees keep trying to suck her back to a darker world but for some reason he is safe, someone who keeps the bad away. But will the past keep coming back to haunt her? Will the things she sees follow her for the rest of her life? Or will she finally be able to forget what had happened to her with the help of a mostly serious, germaphobic man. He might very well be the key that could save her life."
"Eren is a young tropical mer that got lost from his pod. Levi is a deep sea mer that smells Eren and believes him to be his next meal until he comes face to face with the young creature and desides that he wishes to mate. Levi being Levi doesn't have the best approach at first but soon he is about to win him over. (No actual smut, just fluffy courting. MILD violence of the bat because Levi doesn't know what he is doing but he doesn't hurt Eren)"
"The first time Levi comes to Erwin, he sends him away, refusing to take advantage. The second time, he isn't quite that strong. But who is using who?"
"Erwin will be the next commander in a very short time; Levi has lost everything that mattered to him. Their lives are changing; they are heading together toward that landscape painted with mysteries that is on the other side of the walls. The problem will arise when those changes, by reviving old memories, make their minds tortured by past, guilt and fear waver in front of the uncertain. Perhaps, what they need to move forward is to know they can trust someone else. What they don't know is that, in order to build that trust, they will need to undress themselves body and soul before the other, doing so to face the unexpected chain of events that will turn their expectations and dreams upside down. Because only a living heart can fully feel the freedom that awaits them at the end of the battle. *** Eruri, Pre-SNK, Post-ACWNR.

"Levi's thumb traced a repeated path along the slope of Eren's jaw. ""I'd do it, if I had to. If you made me.""

Squinting her eyes to see better, she came to the realization that that something was actually a person. Based on chapter 115. I’ll write a better summary later, but I promise this is good!!"

"After a stroke of terrible luck, you're taken by an enemy nation as a prisoner of war. Your fate? Either to be killed off, or used to negotiate your kingdom's surrender. Of course, that is until you're freed by a group of mysterious combatants who are dead-set on keeping you safe. Though for what reason, you're not very sure.

"Glasses were clinked. Beer was downed in a gulp. A kiss was exchanged. A celebration was what it was supposed to be. A tragedy became what it was unexpected to be. Little did they know that the next day of their lives would not only bring a huge conflict, but a new life as well. A child was what Hanji least expected. But what terrified her more was the fact that the father was a cold, titan shredder. Who it is, you ask? Let's just say that he's the Captain that everybody fears. And she's way too petrified to even tell him. Hearts were broken, with secrets unspoken. Love had bloomed. But will it bring life to the world? Or will it carry humanity's doom?"

"“Sorry, I didn’t mean to stare.” The boy replied awkwardly to which Levi rolled his eyes and looked out the window. “You just look really tired.” Levi’s gut clenched as he looked back and blinked at the young man. In all honesty, Levi didn’t exactly know what to say, and he would never quite understand why five simple words from a person he didn’t know rendered him speechless."
"Levi heads out in the dead of night only to find things complicated when Eren follows him."

"My life had always been the same. The same daily routine for the last two years. I lived in a rather quiet town. It was small with a few people, it wasn’t packed with buildings and high traffic, we had a local mall with a few shops and cafés. There were a couple other stores and food places placed around in the town. One was the one I worked in, ‘CreativeBloom’ , a flowershop. It wasn’t on the big side when it comes to size, but it was cozy and I enjoyed working there. It was placed a little closer to the water, so whenever the sky was clear I had the most stunning view out over the sea. I was still a student. And I was poor. But I didn’t mind. My life hadn’t totally turned to shit yet. I lived a peaceful and happy life honestly I liked it and didn’t see a reason why I would want anything to change. All of that very suddenly changed. After that day one man quite aggressively walked into my store, and changed everything I ever thought I knew. Dianthus- the Latin word for carnations, Levi gets obsessed with them. English isn’t my first language so sorry if I have stupid grammatical mistakes and such^^’"

When are you going to get it!?” “I’m never going to get, okay?! That right there? That kiss? Things like that are exactly why I’m never going to get it, because I know you have feelings for me.

So go ahead, do your worst. Nothing you do will convince me you’re not worth it.”"

Hell, she was the poster child of shady individuals mothers would warn their kids to stay away from; an assassin, a vigilante, a roguish thug, a witty bitch, a stubborn prick, name it. She’d probably been one of those- or all of those- at some point in time. And she wasn’t planning on changing her wily, wily ways.

But then the next it's just problem after problem. People say that's just how life goes but why does it have to? Eren Jaeger, at the age of 18, has a life that has been one huge roller coaster. It was like he couldn't escape it. Trapped in a world where problems surrounded him. Prone to the problems that life hands to him whether he asks for it or not. But writing was his outlet to all these problems, he made stories, short or long, to cope with what he deals with. It made him happy enough to get through life's curveballs. But those moments didn't last long enough once he realized that those won't come true. Nothing is perfect. But when the new guy in town, Levi Ackerman, came into his life by a mere coincidence his life was turned upside down.

After a chance encounter with the paranormal when he was 10 years old, Eren Jaeger was thrown into a world of fear and horror- if he’d ever believed in the stuff. He instead realised, in spite of his experience being unexplainable, that he had a definite gift for the con. Joining forces with his childhood friend, one Armin Arlert, Eren builds up a reputation as a paranormal investigator of the highest order; but every single one of his ‘investigations’ are faked. The money is easy, people are gullible and Eren gets off on the thrill. But then they find an ACTUAL ghost. A ghost that writes notes to anyone who'll listen warning them to 'Get out while you can'.

"Eren has a boyfriend, multiple fuckbuddies, and a blatant disregard for anyone's feelings but his own. Is it ever too late for a chance at redemption? Levi doesn't find himself to be a masochist, but he must be for falling in love with somebody so unattainable. When loving someone comes at the expense of yourself, how much are you willing to give--how much can you give before it breaks you? (Or the petty teenage drama nobody asked for.

Smooth with words, charismatic and undeniably good looking, Eren’s got it all at the back of his hand. Rumour has it every Monday, Jaeger will agree to go out with the first person to ask him out, before promptly breaking up with the said soul on Sunday.

"Levi lives in a tiny apartment where he locks himself away from civilization, except for the off occasion when Hanji drags him out of the house to smell the roses. On one of these occasions, Levi is introduced to probably the most beautiful boy he's ever seen. Eren, on the other hand, finds it hard to believe he'll ever find a guy that isn't a total douche. Between a bad history in romance and a failing flower shop, Levi's afraid he'll never have the chance to win him over."
"Eren hated this Levi person that had just sauntered into his life like he owned the world. This Levi had insulted his manner of speaking, stole his best friend, punched him in the face, and then beat up the other person who punched him. Levi was a shoulder to cry on when someone important had died, was actually much nicer than he acted, and was actually a really good kisser. Levi had beautiful hands, pretty eyes, a lovely rare smile and magic hands that stole thoughts and feelings and locked them in words. Also, he's a closeted sap. Eren loves this Levi person who has been in his life for so many years. Levi hated this Eren kid who had to ruin what might have been a relatively decent second chance at life. This Eren insulted his height, couldn't ever train his dog to stop chewing on everything, tried to tear his only friend away, and punched him in the back of the head. Eren is vulnerable and always needs a shoulder to cry on, pretends to be stronger than he is for reasons that make no sense, and is one seriously sloppy ass kisser. Eren has bright eyes and a crooked grin and magic hands that capture the world. Also, he's good at making tea. Levi loved this Eren person who made everything feel worth it."

"It's a curse to remember, but it's torture to be the only one who does. One day, Jean wakes up, and it isn’t normal. It, his breathing, the universe, the way the world spins when he plants both feet on the floor and tries to haul himself out of bed. It’s the same feeling as being at sea for a long time and forgetting what it means to walk on land. Everything seems to sway, as if he can still feel the ebb and flow of waves beneath his feet, even though he has never seen the ocean in his life. He remembers a different time, a different place, different people, and a different boy."

"When Levi begins dreaming of a strange world he doesn't recognize, he begins to wonder if there is something more behind it than the simple ramblings of an unconscious mind."
"Eren was supposed to only be another blurred face that passed me by through the school corridors; an insignificant human that barely influenced the life I led. So how, through all the curves and ambushes laid out by fate, did he become what he has? A vital piece to all of our lives, the very beating heart that keeps the world moving, coloured, and breathing the life I had craved in the monotone of uniformity. And all this came from the inner boundaries of that fence; the wall that separated us from the tragedy of his life. Eren Jaeger; show me what you hide behind your white picket fence. Show me the monster I know you have become."
"None"
"Being the Commander of the Survey Corps is not as glamorous as it may seem. While Erwin seems to be a very strong, well put together leader, when returns from missions, he crumbles. Thankfully, Levi's there to pick up the pieces. A one shot for Day 4 of Eruri Week ""Touch"". Rated T for nudity and bathing (nothing NSFW)."
"Erwin has always talked in his sleep. This time, Levi talks back."

Eren had found the owner of the words tattoed in his forearm… and he was having an anniversary dinner with someone else -- What if... you found your soulmate a bit too late?"
"Eren, the son of two very wealthy and well-known people, can't bring himself to cut back on smoking- or running into trouble.

Things take a wild turn for the two as Levi tries his damnedest to get his assignment taken care of while Eren is rapidly becoming a fatal distraction for the man."

"Levi, not that he would admit it, was scared of happiness. It seems crazy, but when you think about it, it's really not. When you're happy, it can be taken from you, and Levi had had happiness taken from him more times than most. He was cautious about it. The thing was, Eren was a different kind of happiness. A better kind, that made Levi actually, truthfully happy. Unfortunately, the more happy you are, the easier it is the have the rug pulled from under your feet, and that's exactly what happens."
"Levi has been away from home for five years. When he finally works up the courage to visit again after all this time and renew family ties he thinks everything will be how he left it, except he didn't consider that his sweet and pure little brother is now an attractive and mature grown up that's on his mind more and more often that he cares to admit."

His only clues lay in a journal, which he quickly discovers holds some gruesome secrets."
"more for the sad otp challenge I did on tumblr. I find it sad when two characters like each other but never act on it or choose not to for valid but also disappointing reasons."
"It was a feeling that seeped into his bones. A feeling that took every part of him that was alive and energized, and dulled it all to an almost painful numbness. And here he was. Sixteen going on seventeen, and tired in general. So tired and sad and with it came the anger. He didn't even realize that something was changing until his friends started avoiding him. And by the time he realized, he had already snapped."
"Idk it is literally 3am, do I have to write this??? Levi and Eren have an emotion angsty convo and then they bang, okay?"
"Jean shot an accusing look. “I know you’re seeing Levi behind my back, Eren.” Jean pleads for Eren to stay with him. Levi threatens to end his relationship with Eren if he doesn’t end it with Jean.

"Far, far up the stairs, at the top of the tower, above all but the stars, was Levi. It had been ages since he'd been down there. One hundred and eighty-seven years at his last count, though that, too, had been ages ago. The town itself hadn't even existed then; It had been a mighty expanse of forest. Thirty years later, it was a tiny village. Forty years after that, it was a bustling little town. And one hundred and twenty years after that, the little village had blossomed into what was now the kingdom's capital, the tower neatly placed at one of its many edges. It was lonely, seeing it age so when he hadn't aged at all. Erwin's presence was the only thing that made the ageless decades bearable. A fantasy AU, primarily based upon Rapunzel, in which Erwin is a wizard in charge of keeping Levi, a beast, safely locked away from the rest of the world, no matter the cost."

"Humanity's strongest warrior.  A hero to many, a monster to some.  Seemingly invincible, unflinching and undeterred.  But this legendary soldier as a weakness he cannot escape, and is haunted by the inevitable agony that comes with it.  A ray of light pierces the darkness, only to be snuffed out.  The heart is the enemy.  The beauty is the beast.  Is it ever worth it?"
"Levi’s never been good at saying sorry."
"A new, insanely popular video game has just been released called Attack On Titan. Hanji leaves no room for objections from Levi, and so he's dragged into this virtual gruesome world full of violence, death, and gore. His favorites all in one. But when a glitch in the game brings along a sequence of strange events and a pair of unforgettable eyes, everything Levi thought he knew about gaming turns to ash and he's afraid to face the unsettling truth behind this alluring video game character named Eren."

"Honestly, this summary barely touches on the things in this fic. It started as college AU and has kind of moved in to present drama and past historical mystery drama and possible reincarnation. You just need to start it, give it a chance, and go with the flow. Armin, Eren, and Jean start college and their lives become a dramatic tangle of lies, love, and secrets. Erwin and Levi are two retired marines, RAs at the university, and partners who after nearly dying in Middle East are trying to live their lives peacefully and productively. Unfortunately, things are not as they should be at the university and Levi and Hanji's ground breaking research is the target of a secret group whose influence extends around the world. Erwin feels the need to continue his father's work fighting the group and slowly but surely as it all comes together things become even more convoluted and no one is really who they are or telling the whole truth."
"It's the year 2150 and renowned scientist Hanji Zoe has finally perfected a time machine. Hanji uses it to send Eren back in time. So what happens when he gets stuck in the era of the Titans?

He doesn't have a clue what to do, nor how long it will take his Hanji to get him back to their own time period. He's not trusted and just wants to go home. This was all too weird for him.

"""Upon wandering to their room, he recognized the sound of some soft music. He knew the song almost immediately, since it was more gentle than Marco’s usual stuff, but the song he heard was one saved for special days. Usually days that were rainy, full of melancholy, times of remembrance, or a mixture of the three. Today had seemed like a normal day, but Jean already knew why that song was playing."""

"A school trip to Paris turns into more than Jean could have ever expected. Ever heard of love at first sight? Neither had the freckled boy across the hall. Jean is in for more than he expects, and it all starts with the image of freckles and Jaegers dick."
"Levi is having a rough night, trying to exhaust himself into no-longer remembering anything that might break down his carefully constructed demeanor. Will a certain ocean-eyed cadet be able to help him?"
"Eren sees people's memories when he touches their skin. Dead or alive, he can see them. Fond or Scarring, he can observe them with a single touch. Maybe it's a blessing? His parents used to say. Eren doesn't think so."
"Levi was just getting by, strolling the streets for some extra cash, not to mention he'd get sex from it was a bonus. An unstable, juggled life he was living. Then enters Erwin, a mysterious blond man who strolls into his life with a suitcase full of cash asking for him to quit his 'job.' Levi would have taken it from the first glance but there was something behind that charming smile of his client that made him hesitate. It was dangerous. And Levi was sure he was never going to be able to resist him any longer."

"Levi is tired, and not prepared to deal with a time-traveler, Charles is displaced with no way home, Eren wishes the world would give him a break already, and Hanji's just happy that something interesting is going on. Started as a deconstruction of Offspring-Sues, then took on a life of its own."

"From the very beginning, Levi could only see one shade of blue. From the very beginning, Erwin could only see one shade of green. As time passes, their colors begin to blur, but will they change, or fade?"
"After Marco’s death my depression only got worse. Things at home were still in deep shit, too. So now I’m here, on a bridge by a road where nobody passes through, about to end my life. It’s kind of scary but I’ve realized there is literally nothing for me to live for. I’ve racked my brain for so long trying to think of something, anything that might prevent me from killing myself. But since that seemed to have been a useless effort, I decide it's about time. Nobody will miss me, so there was nothing holding me back. I wasn't expecting to be interrupted by a loudmouthed brunette driving a Ford Mustang."
"Eren watched this and fell to his knees, the tears in his eyes streaming down as he shook his head, “No...no…no no no no no, please…” He could hear feet crushing grass behind him and shouts. “Eren!” They got closer, but he paid no mind to them, only to the figure of a titan running in the distance. He’d lost to that titan once more, just like in the forest. Just like in Stohess. He lost Annie. The only Ereannie submission for the SNK Artist's Big Bang Challenge!"
"My fill for Day 2 (AU/Historical Era) of Thominho Week :) I cheated a little and went for a crossover au set in a semi-historical society, ft. Commander Minho Park of the Survey Corps. I may develop this beyond a oneshot at some point. It was just another day, another scouting mission. And while they had always known it was a possibility, the cold reality is almost too much to bear. A Commander can never allow his personal feelings to colour his judgement. Never."

"Jean is a broke college dropout playing his beat-up guitar for change in the park when he finds his sunshine that breaks through the cloudy skies of his life. ""It all started in this park.

What would make you keep getting up in the morning, give you purpose, give you a reason to survive?  Even as everything falls apart all around him, Marco knows the answer to that question: Jean.  He'd keep going for Jean."
"Everyone dies and my hope dies with them."
"He’d been released from the infirmary the day before, still wearing the pajamas they’d put him in there. Instantly Levi felt a surge of anger. How could those stupid-ass nurses not have seen this coming? He was missing an arm. How the fuck did they expect him to get dressed? “Levi. I’m sorry to ask this of you, but could you…” Erwin trailed off before he could say the word help. There was a look in his eyes that Levi had never seen before- embarrassment mixed with misery mixed with utter hopelessness."
"Reader manages to thaw the icy Levi's heart, and a new adventure begins for them both. Plenty of graphic sexual content, very detailed"
"Look, don’t get me wrong, I have nothing against the whole matrimonial, paternal, fairy tale life. It’s just not for me, not for Jean Kirstein. I mean, I’ve got a decent job, a nice place to live, awesome friends, what else could I ask for? Call me a free spirit, that’s okay, because, whoever came up with this idea that you have to fall in love, live in a huge mansion, have lots of babies in order to live happily ever after is just not true. Or so I thought, before a freckled doctor told me some life changing news that screwed everything up. (A Little Bit of Heaven AU)"

Despite liking both boys more than he should, he keeps his emotions to himself and finds a girl to date. For one month he's in complete relationship bliss until it all comes crashing down one Saturday night when Marco appears at their door. An imagining of what could go wrong between best friends and confused college kids in love. This in the same vein as Don't Wait but an alternative ending of the dispute at the end of chapter 2. This is not canon to tat story and never will be canon to that story bc I'm not that cruel."
"Ever since Eren was a child, he wanted to go to the Olympics. He wanted to be the best of the best. Several years later and nothings really changed, besides a few scars that he's still healing from. But at least his dream is coming true. Well, his dream is a year and one massive tournament away, but it's coming true. All he has to do is get top scores at this tournament and he'll be on his way to Rio! There's a few problems, though. His father has never approved of this dream, his friends are constantly worrying about him (which just stresses him out), there's a douche-bag with a horse face from France, and his biggest idol is also competing. Things become even more complicated when he realizes that he's falling in love with his idol, a beauiful, short man from France. No it's not the horse-face guy. It's someone he never expected to compete with. Levi Ackerman. Or the one where two boys that wear a lot of spandex and do flips'n'stuff fall in love and succeed at being totally rad gymants. (A.K.A the fic no one asked for but I desperately needed.)"
"""Levi, your grades are surprising me lately."" The senior said nothing to this, but continued to stare at Erwin evenly with his dark grey-blue eyes, his mouth set in a firm line as if to defy that anything was amiss. The professor went on, ""I know that you're under a lot of stress, being in your senior year, but that's normal and you're not one to let mere stress break you so easily. You've proven that to me over the years, so please tell me, what's going on with you?"" It was very obvious that Levi did not want to have this conversation. His thin fingers tightened on the strap of his shoulder bag, his jaw set in even closer, and his eyes dropped swiftly from his professor's blue ones. After a few uncomfortable seconds of silence, he muttered, ""Nothing."""

Unfortunately, Eren is found and killed by the very hunters he used to work with, and Levi does nothing but blame himself. 200 years later, Levi meets a certain green-eyed boy, similar to that of his lover.  Levi now believes that he is the reincarnation of him. Not knowing whether fate is being cruel or giving him a second chance, Levi decides to not get involved with him. Eren, however, is having dreams about the man he's never met until now and wants to know why."

For now, all that's left to do is try to survive 'til graduation—and perhaps even learn a little about each other before then. [FINALLY OFF HIATUS AND ONGOING!]"
"People always fantasize about having unique lives full of excitement and adventure. But take off that romanticized mask that media places on EVERYTHING now a days and the reality of it is far less than charming. Eren might have been a 'magical boy', but he didn't fight for any of that love and friends nonsense. He fought to survive. What will happen when a man who's been at this game almost twice as long meets and than has to work with the walking corpse of a boy?"
"After the battle against the beast titan, Levi is furious at Eren for going on a wild rampage, even though he'd won. But, at what cost did Eren win?"
"It wasn’t like Jean didn’t want to have a family one day because he did. Kind of. In a far off abstract ‘one day’ kind of way. After school, after he found the right person, after he was settled down...all that stuff. But one stupid party, one freckled alpha, and one little purple plus sign change everything."
"They say that he's humanity's most powerful soldier. This—this is humanity's greatest weapon. It's almost beautiful."

"Jean/Armin High School AU. Lots of fluff, a little bit of angst."
"At 10, he witnessed the massacre of his family and friends. His mother had sacrificed herself so that he would be able to run away and hide. He still regrets that decision; He believed if he stayed and fought, he wouldn't have had to watch everyone get killed. All of this, he thought. All that killing just for eyes. They weren't special, but the color captured everyone's attention. At 15, while holding the daughter of a family that took him in, he realized he brought death wherever he went. So he ran. Ran until he couldn't no more. At 17, he doesn't trust anyone. He doesn't smile nor laugh. At 19, he's ready to die. He's cornered by the same people who killed his family and as he closes his eyes, he's saved. For the first time in years, he makes a friend. The only problem is, he's told to hide his eyes if he wants to live. It isn't easy when suddenly he has to live in a house with people after his eyes.

But that had always been when Armin and Mikasa were there beside him, and before he had discovered his Titan-shifting abilities. Now with his new 'home' being filled with nothing but hateful words and whispered threats towards him from the people he couldn't escape, Eren is finding his resolve rapidly crumbling as he loses sight of being anything more than the heartless monster everyone accuses him of being. What does Levi think when the teen suddenly goes missing? Could he possibly help Eren see that he isn't just a wreckless monster? Or will he be too late to help at all?

Running into a short, grumpy, writer by day, then an extremely attractive stripper of sorts by the night? Could Eren even find anything in such a not so uninteresting life? Or could this begin something more life changing than the words he had heard of his mother's health? Modern AU"

Levi, who comes from a rich family, decides to become a police officer to help the poor and he really makes a difference to a poor boy stealing an apple. A boy with eyes as green as the apple."
"After the death of his mother, Eren is left completely broken. To make matters worse, his father blames Eren for her death, and constantly reminds him of this with both emotional and physical abuse.

"A quick fic about what the Regiments do with the soldiers who... Let's say aren't exactly fit to serve any more. I'm not talking about Soldiers who have perhaps lost a limb and can't fight any more, nope I'm talking soldiers that have totally lost it. And can you blame them?"
"Sasha clapped her hands together, leaning towards him. Her eyes little up mischievously, and Eren was a bit scared by the smile that appeared on her face. “All you have to do,” she began, her voice low to add an air of mystery, “is flip a coin.” Sasha and Connie convince Eren to let them decide his fate for a week through coin-flipping.

"They finally manage to break Annie out of  her crystal, but she has amnesia. Eren is determined to get her memories back."
"“I’m sorry.” “For what?” “Everything?” Levi contemplated what he was feeling. Beginning to feel overwhelmed, he let out a shaky breath. “I’m not sure…” “Levi.” Eren sighed. It’s as if they’ve been through this a thousand times. The same mindless apologies followed by the same dejected look."

"I turned around and my jaw dropped. I was staring into light grey eyes. I had seen this vampire before. He was one of the vampires that had attacked my village. I couldn’t help but gape at him as I remembered that day. I remembered seeing my dead friends and family littered across blood spattered grass. I remembered my body pulsing with hatred as we charged at each other, both with the cutthroat intention to tear the other apart. He was scowling at me, his thinly sculpted, cruel face appearing more handsome than I remembered. The harsh lamplight caused shadows to creep under his eyes and down his neck, somehow making him seem even more attractive. “Who the hell are you looking at, boy?”"

"Levi has always remembered. The war, the Titans, all of it. Most people would think he was crazy if he told them; in this world, after all, it was physically impossible for humans to turn into man-eating giants several meters tall. Levi himself might have doubted his sanity if he hadn't met others with familiar faces. Others that remembered that world surrounded by the Walls. Not all of them recall their past lives, though, and Levi isn't sure if he envies them or not. When Levi runs into a young man with achingly familiar green eyes and no memory of the history they shared, Levi's first instinct is to push him away, to let him live this life with a freedom he never had in the other. He doesn't count on Eren being just as stubborn this time around as the last, memories or no."

This is an AU and BL fic, which mean yaoi, which means boy on boy. You have been warned, if you don't like it, don't read it."
"Contrary to popular belief, Levi wasn't a cold and heartless killing machine. He was only human and the world be damned if he wasn't allowed to grieve for his team. For her."
"He would wait even for hundreds of years to see him again, even just for a fleeting moment. He had kept his silent promise, and now it was his turn."
"He'll tell him. Of course he will. It can't be worse than facing Titans, or being caught tracking mud inside by Levi, or stealing food from Sasha.

The only times he feels slightly less buried are the mornings when he chats with the blond-haired cutie who runs the coffee shop near campus.

"Summary in notes."
"“When did you start liking him?” “I don’t know.” And he doesn’t. He tries to think about when something changed, something significant, but nothing comes to mind.

It was such a gradual thing that Levi didn’t realize he even felt that way himself until he was kissing Mike in the hallway."

"Everyone has a soulmate, but not everyone gets to meet and live happily ever after with that soulmate. People wait years for the name to appear on their skin and longer searching for the person that name belongs to. The lucky ones get their names as children and find their mates during adolescence or young adulthood, and the really lucky ones get that happily ever after.

"To wear a mask every day can be tiring, facade maintained at all times to block out reality and start anew. It can also be a source of enjoyment, playing the part of someone possessing qualities that weren't instilled since birth, characteristics chosen instead of predetermined. When one such individual collides with another cut from the same cloth, inevitable sparks fly, strong yet false personalities steady and unwavering as there's never any fear of letting anyone get too close, solid walls high and impenetrable. Usually. What happened was unexpected, foreign, minds not prepared for the events that came from a chance meeting during one of many guises. Someone walked into Eren's life and pulled those barriers down without even trying, allowing their own to crumble in the process, the results as surprising as they were exciting."

"Eren Jaeger was confused. He didn't know how he was supposed to feel. He was used to have such loving friends. He used to be a gung-ho, happy-go-lucky kinda guy. He used to enjoy life and what it offered. And now he was swamped with projects and losing sleep. He spent his days alone despite being used to the company of others. He felt like he was losing some unknown battle he didn't sign up for. He didn't have anyone to turn to nor had any one to even bother updating about his daily life. He felt dread. He felt like he was deeply wronged. He felt collectively scrutinized. He needed an outlet, or else he would definitely go crazy. So Eren did what any millennial with real-life struggles did―he started his own personal online journal."
"Eren had always thought that he was untouchable, having everything he wanted, getting spoiled by his sister, who is the head of one of the biggest Gangs in the city of Shiganshina. But after an unfortunate run in with a couple of desperate rival gang members, Eren and Armin were backed into a corner. Literally. Now the spoiled prince has to learn to fend for himself in a world of deals and underground operations, and that means no more gifts, no more apartment, and most importantly, no one to run crying to. Oh how the mighty have fallen. He held a gun to my chest and pulled the trigger. He's the Queen Bee and I fell to his stinger."
"Jean misses Marco. He misses him so much. More than a year has passed since his death, but Jean still can't come to terms with it. But then one day, Jean discovers Marco's ghost, and things slowly start to get better."
"Rain was pouring down on the glass of his bedroom windows, filling the silence in the room. Lightning struck somewhere nearby, though it went unnoticed as Levi cradled his head with his forearms as he stared at the floor blankly. Thunder cracked through the night, shaking even the sturdy house where Levi sat. The last time Levi saw his lover was yesterday, and it was far too long for him."
"But if one thing is going to change, it’ll be Armin. He’s going to get his future. Eren will make sure of it this time."

"All Eren ever wanted was to be loved."

"Levi is Eren's captain, and Eren assumed it would always be that way. Captain and subordinate, the way it was meant to be. But, when Eren's heat hits and the two can't resist each other, will the change be for the better, or the worse? Especially with the extraordinary circumstances that follow. There were orders they were meant to follow, rules that were not meant to be broken, and repercussions that would be dire, but no one can withstand the battering of wild instincts indefinitely and even taciturn captains sometimes have slip ups.

"They said that love turned up when least expected, hiding round the corner to take you by surprise and steal the breath from your lungs. You'd never believed in such drivel, convinced life held nothing but short relationships which ended in disappointment, until an unannounced and old-fashioned incident made you think otherwise. Maybe there was someone out there to claim your heart, hold it gently and take you to heights never before experienced.

It didn't matter, though; he apologised and swore it wouldn't happen again. Then the cheating started. And the lying. And it just got worse and repeated itself until it was routine for Eren to degrade Levi every morning and fuck him into oblivion by nightfall. There's a soloution, Levi knows it; it just lies on a farm full of secrets and the last thing he expected: Hope."

"The rattle of his front door did nothing to stir Eren as he continued to stare at the video of the courtroom before him. “Levi Ackerman, this jury finds you guilty of twelve counts of murder in the first degree and hereby sentences you to the maximum penalty equal to that of your crimes in the form of twelve consecutive life sentences to be served in a maximum security penitentiary without the possibility of parole,” a woman’s voice spoke through the speakers. Eren felt his heart clench. “Eren,” said a voice from behind him. Armin had come to visit once again. He felt a hand press onto his shoulder from where he sat, trying to garner attention away from his Raven. “Eren… This is unhealthy. You need to eat... You need to sleep… I need you to take care of yourself, please,” Armin said with a hoarse voice, choked by the state of his best friend. “No,” Eren said, shrugging off his hand. “What I need to do is be here for Levi when he needs me.”"

Thankfully, a man called Levi is there to keep him safe (although be it begrudgingly, at first)."
"Annie and Mikasa try to have a baby."
"Eren and Levi thought that nobody would understand, when in reality, they were more alike than they thought. Eren is a nerd and a bit of an otaku and Levi is captain of the football team, when they first meet, they don't thin much of each other. But, will their unmistakable ""lack of interest"" for each other be the beginning of something beautiful? Or is this some other way life decided to mess with them?

"Jean finally to Mikasa, but things blow up in a way he didn't expect."
"Levi runs a gentle finger down the tiny slope of her nose, presses a kiss to her forehead. “I think she has your nose.” “The poor child,” Erwin sighs sadly, shaking his head. “Hopefully, she has your eyebrows.” Levi glances up. “I don’t see anything wrong with your eyebrows.” “You know what they say. Love is blind.”"

"Being with one person your whole life is a mirrage provoked by the romanticising of the one true love. It is much more realistic to believe that you will be with several people, each one drawn in your life depending on the period in your development as a person. This story is a nerrative of five of those people, who played an important part in your life."

"Eren left. No one leaves Levi. He found him, and he'll never let go again. This a DARK fanfic. It's not fluff, it's not sunshine and rainbows, it's dark.

"Levi sits and waits.  He has no idea how much time has passed since they returned.  Time no longer works the way it did Before .  It slips away from him now, trickling through his fingers like dust. He spends hours sitting by the window in the mess hall,  tie in hand, the familiar green stone smooth, warm and solid in his palm. The hardest thing to bear is the simple absence, the fact that Erwin is no longer here."
"Levi had lost everything; his family, his home, his job and his friends – turning to drugs and alcohol just to forget all of the pain he felt inside. Once being quite the success story, he was an ever so popular workaholic who fell off the rails after an unfortunate event that rendered him an orphan. A lonely broken heart is something which could only be forgotten under the influence of whatever drug he could lay his hands on.

"This is the story of the last two humans left on this planet, who pass their final days living at the center of the world."
"Levi never wanted most of his arguments with Erwin to end with bruises and slammed doors. He had no intention of joining the damned military, let alone the fucking Survey Corps; and he certainly never wanted to have anything to do with falling in love. Then again, he never seems to get what he wants, does he?"
"After having a few rough nights sleeping, Jean is visited by someone he did not expect."
"Levi didn’t expect to fall in love. Eren didn’t expect to be fallen in love with. Neither of them expected Eren to start losing control of his titan form- and no one could’ve predicted what came next."

Whether it's to find out what underwear he was wearing so they could be partnered up for an art project or standing up against bullies that would do anything to keep them apart. Levi would keep chasing after him, holding Eren's words close to his heart from their destined meeting. He knew that someone who could create a tranquil atmosphere with just a luminous captivating smile is someone he should never let go of.

"I placed my hands either side of her face still looming over her. She was still beautiful even with fresh bruises encasing her neck like a collar. I pressed my face into the crook of her neck and inhaled her smell. She sent me over the edge, she is like a drug to me I can't ever have enough. I pressed a few kisses to the new bruises before standing up over her waiting for (y/n) to finish coughing and choking. Once she sat up and her breath settled, I bent down to her height.

He freezes up, thinks of calling out to her to see if this is some sort of cruel joke, but some horrible, twisted feeling in the pit of his stomach keeps him from it. Instead, he turns around, his palms slippery with sweat as he does the only thing he can think of; he goes to Armin's house and, without knocking or asking permission, opens the front door and slips inside.

Looking at him, Levi was almost afraid to breathe in case it turned out that Eren Jaeger really would be incompatible by his scent.

"Behind him, Maria rumbles. Her sisters are circling above, their low, beautiful cries ringing through the still air. It’s all quiet now. The battle to retake the city had been brutal; Tybur’s trickery forcing Eren to take drastic action. He’d not begun the day intending to burn the city, but when the surprise attacks on his men and the wildfire explosions had begun, he’d had no choice. He’d had no choice. It was either the civilians who had sat by while his parents were murdered and he and Mikasa and Armin had been driven out of the country and left to starve, or the soldiers who had followed him gladly all the way from across the sea. He owes the people who chose him his loyalty, his protection. It’s a shame, but such is war. His hand had been forced. He had no other choice.

""It smells like a human"" he proceeded. They all stepped back when it moved its wings. So, it's still alive but unconscious. The sudden movement of it uncovered its body and had let them see what it was hiding but what they saw drained the blood from their face.

Its roots travelled all to way through the surrounding bushes; and its branches, let little light show through its foliage. But that's not what Squad Leader Erwin and his comrades stared at with glimmering eyes. No, it was something much more endearing; much more intricate. They were beaming at the beautiful young girl embedded in that tree. Her small body almost merged with the bark; where her long, luscious, wavy brown hair fell.

Like some swampish black and dirty facsimile of what he felt for Erwin in those early days. “What do you want, Zeke?” He breathes. “An opportunity” Zeke says, carefully, as though he’s picking through the words to find the perfect ones. “A chance to put this to rest. An opportunity to test if ties really do bind, Levi, Make some new ones. Am I really such a terrible alternative?” Levi considers it; Considers the tension and fear that’s been wrought through him since Zeke first started staring at him like a specimen and not an adversary.

Meanwhile, Killua looked at Levi and the Eldians and was reminded of Gon, a friend who had also lost an ability that made him who he was. Killua and Alluka were then also forced to confront what it could look like for Alluka to give up a power that have both opened up possibilities and made her a monster."

That’s what I’m here for.” The old man laughs. Hard. “Oh?” he says. “Taking one monster out of your world to put it in ours?” If he thinks he can hurt Eren by calling him a monster, he’s wrong. Eren knows good and well what he is.

"All of his life, Winston was surrounded by walls, but he never felt trapped by them. Strangely enough, he found comfort in them, comfort that something so tall and strong could keep him safe. Whenever he looked up, sunlight always peeked over, making the ledge seem endless. But he never wanted to know what was over on the other side, all he wanted was to reach the top to look down at his little world before finally reaching his end."
"""I'm so sorry, Jean..."" Jean doesn't know how to reply. He doesn't really want to. All he can think of right now, and all he's been able to think about for the last few days, is how he could have prevented this; how he could have been less of an idiot. All he had wanted to do was be a hero."
"There is a moment before Armin finishes helping Eren up into the airship where Levi entertains the notion that since leaving them, Eren has presented as an omega. But then all that is washed away with the stench of him—Eren’s an alpha and Levi’s an alpha and that changes nothing and Levi thinks, fuck , and no , and, I can’t do this again ."

As Erwin gets closer to Levi and begins to uncover the twisted history of the long empty Magnolia Mansion, strange things start happening, and he becomes inextricably tangled in the town's net of mysteries. Soon, Erwin isn't sure if there is a way out, or if the things that lie unseen will devour him before he can find the answers he's looking for."
"Canon divergence, post-ACWNR events | Levi hadn’t paid much attention to Squad Leader Hange Zoë the first time they met, too caught up in their plan to take Erwin Smith down. However, in the aftermath of his first expedition –and in spite of saying he didn’t want to be responsible for anyone else’s lives– Levi can’t refuse the helping hand Hange is lending for him to take. Accepting, it is probably a choice he might come to regret later because the squad leader seemed the type of person who just roots into one’s heart, making it impossible harder letting go –if time came."

"“Look, Levi! It’s another frog!” Hange pointed out. Levi held her on his back, carrying her across the muddy path leading back home. The weather turned from a downpour into a light rain so naturally, Hange dragged Levi out from his home to look at the frogs and worms that emerged during the drizzle.

"The words Levi had wanted to say were right there, on the tip of his tongue, but he had always been bad with words. What he actually said, made him want to hang up, throw the phone as far away as he could, curl up and die."
"“I’ve come with a proposal.” Levi fished out a cigarette from his backside pocket. Lighting it, he looked through his lashes at the man. “I expect dinner and a movie first.” No trace of a smile.

There is only one person he wants to see. Lay eyes on him one last time and he'll die with no regrets. He looks up and levels the guard with a calm stare. ""I want Levi"" he says simply."
"Eren is strong. Unbreakable, and yet. He is fragile. So, so, fragile. Sometimes Armin feels as if all it would take was one more person, one more death, one more betrayal. For that is all Eren has known, and that is all Eren is. In all his beautiful glory, Eren is a destructive torrent of devastating anger and hate. Nothing more, nothing less. And yet. And yet Eren, in all his eminence, is able to love. Which is more, so much more than others can say. So much more than Armin can say. But love is a complicated thing. Love corrupts, it twists and it distorts. It is so much easier to hate. But hate isn’t the opposite of love. It is indifference. And that is a painful thing to realise indeed."

"Connie is sad so he calls you up for a late night fuck."
"A deep-set shock had gripped her, had rattled her to her core as she recognized the face she knew like the back of her hand below all the blood, gashes and shrapnel. For a second, she had assumed the worst. But his body was warm underneath her touch. And as she lay her hand discreetly on his chest, the heart below her palm thumped. It was the same, familiar rhythm she heard all the time as she lay against him during the nights when sleep evaded the two of them. Still steady. Still beating. And it was in that moment when Hange swore: No matter what- even if it cost her own life- she was going to make sure that Levi would stay alive."
"Love is complicated, Zoe had always thought. So why did he make it so easy?"
"No matter how many times he does it, no matter how hard he tears into his own body with soaps too harsh for his skin, he never feels any less disgusting. He never feels any less awful. He never forgets the blood, or the mud, or the shit. He never lets the people out of his head, and never forgets their names, and he certainly never forgets their corpses. ((AKA: After sustaining a head injury which results in temporary, but severe, short-term memory loss, Levi is forced to confront events from his past that he had always used to push himself forward.

"Levi thinks the end of the world looks like this. Flashes of children’s faces, painted white with fright, the darkness of the basement covering them like a blanket, doing nothing else to provide comfort. If the world is about to end, this will be the last thing he sees, the bodies surrounding him, shaking with life to stave off the cold and then, the next, frozen stiff and covered in ash and debris."
"Levi's not sure why his chest aches when he looks at Eren. Eren hasn't done anything to hurt him—Levi doesn't even know him that well yet. But, for some reason, when Levi looks at Eren, he aches, he regrets, and he gets an overwhelming desire to help. And then he gets these feelings of deja vu, dreams with Eren in them, memories of injuries he's never had— And Eren knows things. About what has happened. What will happen. He needs Levi's help to stop it. If it'll ease the ache in Levi's chest—if it will satisfy the urge to help constantly burning within him—Levi will do whatever it takes. or Levi and Eren finally get their happy ending, but it takes several lifetimes to get there."

"I'd woken up. After dying. Because I tried to stop a little girl getting killed the same way. Oh my Madara's hair stylist. How? Then I immediately shook that thought away. My world had no abnormalities, so it'd have to be something in this world that got me in this shit and I didn't want to stick my hands in some voodoo experiment project or black magic galore. ""Praise the walls!"" A voice warbled. ""The Gods had blesse-"" Somehow everything clicked as my clarity returned like a metaphorical truck, memories dope-slapping me to the next era.

"Set mostly in a hospital room in the weeks after Erwin loses his arm, he and Levi learn to navigate their closeness and confront their selfishness. - Looking back, Levi realised he should not have done what he did next. But it was the way Erwin looked in that moment. That, and the outline of light silhouetting the slant of his unbalanced, pitched body. He drew the devil towards him and kissed him on the lips. “Was this what it was, then? For this long?” Afterwards, Erwin whispered into the hollow of Levi’s neck. The Captain nodded before he meant to, wanting to see the light that would bloom slowly in the other man’s eyes. “Oh.” Erwin breathed. “It’s been the same for me. That’s what makes it so difficult.”"
"“ He sat up and watched his horse run off, but something was wrong, the equipment was wrong. Leather straps hung from her saddle that weren’t supposed to be there, and two big metal things were also somehow attached to the whole shit show. Levi felt lighter. He felt naked. He patted his legs looking for the reassuring weight, and that’s when his stomach dropped. His ODM gear… That’s what had gotten caught, that’s what had dragged him, that’s what had snapped! Now he was completely exposed. He suddenly felt naked. If a titan came now there would be nothing he could do.” Levi falls off his horse outside the walls and is left exposed and helpless."

"Who the hell would be stupid enough to visit Jean Kirschtein at 2am during a thunderstorm? Eren Jaeger, of course. While his old rival could be stubborn at times, something is wrong for him to come to Jean of all people. Once Eren begins to open up about things, Jean begins to understand where shit hit the fan for his friend and helps him as best he can. By trading insults and offering tough love. Be prepared for a lot of dumb humor and angry boyfriends being nerds."
"Eren Jaeger is a nobody. He's not attractive, he's not smart, and he's not strong. He also gets bullied a lot, mostly for being gay. Yet, somehow he works up his courage and manages to confess his feelings to the ever popular Levi Ackerman! After being brutally turned down though, Eren begins to grow somewhat violent, needing something to take his anger out on. He wasn't strong, though, and usually ended up losing every fight his partook in. And by some twisted turn of events, Eren ends up dating one of the guys who bullied him; Jean Kirschtein. Over the summer Eren starts working out with Jean. He fixes up his appearance and toughens himself up, deciding that he would definitely start getting the respect he deserved from others.

"One day Levi leaves Eren without really telling him why or when he will come back. ""I don't have the time to explain. Eren, don't worry, I'll eventually come back. Be a good boy and wait for me."" As the days go on, Eren meets different people that will influence his life and his decisions. Time passes and Eren is somewhat willing to let go of Levi and start a new life. Or will he? It's up to the readers to come up with ideas and decide what happens next. Will Levi come back? What are his intentions for leaving? What relationships will form during Eren's life?"
"For every time that they're together, their hearts and minds do not hesitate to open up. A string of few LeviHan fics that I've accumulated over the past months. Basically, this is my LeviHan drabble dump."
"On a relatively straight-forward trip outside of the walls, Eren is seriously injured and Levi is forced to face up to feelings he's been trying to ignore for entirely too long.

"Some scars don't heal with time. Levi knows it very well."
"Levi looks at Eren expectantly. Eren took the invitation. “So, here I am just blabbing like an idiot. You’re probably not even gay, but…will you go out to dinner with me one time?” That was the first time he realized he liked Eren Jaeger."
"A/N: Essentially, the one in which Levi ditches his car and ends up half-frozen on Eren’s doorstep, and then falls harder for Eren in four days than he’s ever fallen for anyone in his life. Basically, this story shall contain roaring fires, hot chocolate, a whole roster of adorable animals (cause Eren’s spending his reading week watching over Hanji’s farm in frozen Alberta, whereas Levi is an author who lives in Vancouver), a bunch of cuteness with Eren and Levi bonding over nerdy shit; and, essentially, Levi and Eren being trapped together for days, with both of them realizing just how compatible they are, and with both of them aware of the fact that they're from different worlds and live entire provinces apart. - - - Levi’s known this kid for maybe four hours. There’s no reason for him to feel this protective. The wind’s still howling outside, though, and Levi still can’t feel his toes. Eren may well have saved his life, by opening his door. Maybe Levi’s allowed to feel a bit protective in return. - - - Now with gorgeous chapter ten art by strawberryxtruffles . Thank you so much, m'dear. :)"

And why do I have a letter with my name on it saying I'm in love with him, and that he is going to die? Who is this guy? And how is he so important? Those were Levi's first thoughts when he realized that the letter he received wasn't lying, and was basically giving him directions to a happy life. But, who is Eren? And why does he make such an impact on Levi's life 10 years from now? A story of love, drama, and inevitable love triangles."
"[JeanMarco] Modern!AU where Marco is the cute neighbor who moves into the vacant apartment next to Jean. Jean, sadly, is pretty much a lazy college student who prefers the safe haven of his house than the warm bustling city outside. Guess he's waking up earlier now just to see Marco water his plants and hang out his laundry. Before he knew it, he's pretty much head over heels over the cutie, and, well, very gay. However, after he gets to know more about Marco, unforeseen circumstances take place and Jean realizes he landed himself into something he will probably never be able to get out of."
"“Can’t sleep?” Her voice was low and sluggish. Levi leaned his elbows on the stone barrier, eyes idly scanning the moonlit fields that surrounded the castle the scouting regiment was using as a temporary bunkhouse. He simply sipped his tea in response. “Me neither.”"

"When  his parents and Mikasa die in a car wreck at the age of twelve, Eren is lost and lonely, until he meets Levi.  After being together for eight years, he loses Levi to cancer and is thoroughly broken.  He sees Levi everywhere, talks to him, argues with him, and even if he knows its not real Eren doesn't truly want him to disappear.  If it means he's sick, he doesn't want to get better.  A year after Levi's death he gets a letter from him, written before he passed.  Levi wants Eren to move on, go back to school, move out of their house, and make something of his life.

"The story of Eren and Levi is told years later when archaeologists search through the chaos which the war left behind to uncover answers.

"Historical AU: Contrary to popular belief, men can get quite lonely while they are away at war. The seek the companionship of others who calm them, and relationships aren't surprising between two males. Why not go for it, when at any second they could die? Levi finds it downright annoying when he is constantly pressured to find a companion. That's not what he believes. He only wants a relationship based on love and trust, not lust. That's why he's content waiting for his beautiful fiance, Petra Ral. But when he saves a bright eyed brat, he's forced to re-evaluate his thoughts on a relationship. Will he go with the brat...or wait for his fiance?"

All of this becomes a lot more complicated when Connie notices that Jean's latest boyfriend is embarrassed of their relationship, and using him for sex.

"It's mankind's primal yearning to touch the stars, discover the universe in all it's infinite glory; he sees the most beautiful parts of the world in her, his need for it tearing him apart, and he is only comforted by the knowledge that he's not alone in his longing for the unattainable.

"Shortly after the beginning of the new century, deep-space surveillance led to an alarming conclusion: the Earth would soon be struck by a group of small asteroids. In desperation, the Federation of Central Sina developed Stonewall, a massive anti-air ballistic weapon, in the center of the Three Sisters continent. The weapon, for the most part, worked. However, after the danger passed, Sina realized just how powerful a weapon it had. Using Stonewall, The Sina National Coalition established air superiority over the entire Three Sisters Territory. Conventional ground forces were no match for aerial barrage from the Sina air force, and Legion forces were forced to retreat to the island of Trost, beyond Stonewall's range. Weakened and fragmented, Legion learns of a final air strike to be conducted on their headquarters and scrambles what few elite pilots it has left to counter-attack. Follow the efforts of Legion, mostly through the eyes of one of its most elite pilots, as they take on a vital role in Legion’s efforts to defeat the SNC and finally end the war. *Better Summary is better!*"

"Mikasa's first confrontation with Levi"
"Eren's feelings towards his Captain only increase the closer they get to their next, most dangerous as of yet, mission. He tries to respect Levi enough and keep his little crush to himself but it seems like the older man is far more observant than he'd initially believed him to be. Yet, as Levi keeps pushing him away, Eren starts to figure out that perhaps his Captain is hiding something of his own. Who is Levi exactly? How compassionate is he? What's up between him and Erwin? Why is his sense of humour so atrociously bad? What makes him tick? Most of all, how deeply exactly does he care for the young boy?"
"He remembered the time in horrendous detail: The fear of a new day and new horrors that plagued the men, women, and children of Europe that not even the Devil could create. It was a time where he feared that if the fighting just stopped, he would see the true monster that the war created out of him. Yet nothing would compare to the accumulation of grief and guilt that grew over those few short years, no matter how hard he tried to repress it. He would be branded throughout the rest of his life...if he survived."
"""I think Levi views Erwin as a guiding light, sort of. No matter what happens around Levi, it's a comfort having Erwin who will never waver and keep moving forward. Someone who understands the same pain as you, someone who has the same ambitions as you and someone who will keep guiding you to your destination."""
"Erwin Smith, from the Austrian mountains, has only one dream: to go to America and live in luxury. Yet with his arm blown off by a shell, he is sent to work at a household in Poland. It's there he meets a man behind a long, high fence, with gaunt cheeks and burning eyes. ""His breath must have felt hot and sharp – Erwin feels heavy with sadness and delirious with delight at the sight of this almost skeletal man eating the food that he had stolen from the crooked house. He looks at the fine, squirrel-like bones of Levi’s hands and the criminal way he grabbed at cakes so they squished into his palm – so many things broke so easily in Nazi Germany and he hopes this will not break."""
"Eren left four years ago for college in Germany and Jean never quite understood why he was angry about it. Why wouldn't he *want* his greatest rival to leave? Eren returns four years later with something to hide and to find Jean worse than he was when he left."
"""You'll feel at ease with him,"" Mikasa had insisted. ""You'll see."" Seven months and fourteen days later, he's feeling the cavity of his rib-cage being hollowed out bit by bit in the shape of Levi's name, and it's anything but easy. (Wherein Eren learns, painstakingly, the purpose of implicit rules.)"
"After a one night stand, Armin finds himself in a life long commitment...just not one he was quite ready for."

"The 104th military program isn't what everyone was made to believe- nothing is. With the teens being experimented on and changed into beings that are not what the laws of nature dictate to be human, Armin and Annie struggle to come to terms with the fact that everything they knew before has been forever changed. With the lives of their friends, and themselves, on the line, it's up to the duo to find a way out to warn the Survey Corporations of the Trainee Division’s wrongdoings. But with officers hot on their trail, will it be possible?"
"Erwin and Levi talk."
"For Ms. Amy, the owner of the tumblr URL ARUANI for her 22nd birthday! Love you Amy!!!!"
"Eren Jaeger dreams of living in a world where his sister is alive and he doesn’t have to use his treasured coping mechanisms to feel something other than pain. But life has a way of crushing everything in its destructive path, and Eren finds himself in a downwards spiral that doesn’t appear to be heading up anytime soon. As captain of Shiganshina High's football team, Levi Ackerman acts as a pillar of support for his teammates. But once he’s off the field and out of his jersey, he becomes just Levi . Levi Ackerman may be able to help other people, but Levi sure as hell can’t fend for himself against his alcoholic uncle. No one else has felt their pain, no one else has lived through what they have, and no one else will ever understand them. But everything changes once they strike up an unconventional relationship that forces them to bare all of their scars."
"1943. The war had been raging on for three years, twenty two year old Levi Ackerman has come face to face with the draft. He must now fight for his country. With no family left to see him off, he runs into a young man, Eren Jeager, an intern journalist. With only the image of a bleak future in his mind, he entrusts the young man with his family’s key, telling him to keep in touch with him if he lives. He leaves Eren with his information and sets off for war. Along the way Eren comes face to face with activists, veterans, egotists, and learns more about the horrid war this hopeless solider is involved in."
"I'm bleeding out. No hope. My time is limited. The phone keeps ringing. Jean. He can't know I'm dying. I can't tell him. I don't want this to be the last memory he has of me. But I need to hear his voice... One last time..."
"With the people he loves by his side, Erwin finds some beauty in the solace of death."
"Everything is perfect through Marco's eyes. Until he walks in on Jean and everything changes."
"Levi lives his life with the curse of inhabiting a monster inside his body. He changes into something that isn't human when the moon is at its fullest each month and goes on a killing spree. He can't do anything about it and tries to bear with the burden on his own with no one knowing of his condition besides his two close friends. He's terrified of what he is and how there is always the chance he will carry yet another innocent person's blood on his hands. Trying to protect everyone from the beast, Eren comes stumbling, quite literally, into one of his classes one day and their relationship takes off. While Levi is terrified of their relationship and fears for Eren's life, Eren just might be able to save Levi from the monster within."
"For all those who have fallen. Take a minute silence to honour their memories. The three regiments hold a remembrance service for all those who had died in the hands of a titan. For the young cadets, thinking of the falling comrades is the hardest thing they have ever had to do. Being strong in front of everyone was the most becoming unbelievably difficult. ""When can their glory fade? O the wild charge they made! All the world wondered. Honour the charge they made! Honour the Light Brigade, Noble six hundred!"""

"“Okay brat, you have two god damn choices. I can kill you now or you can become my pet.” Mafia/Fight Club AU where Levi is the head of some sketchy organization and Eren is a college drop out who accidentally discovers this underground paying field."
"The 104th is a group of teens that go on missions for an organization of a higher up they never met. They were all gathered together since they were smaller and grew into a very close-knit group. Eren, Armin, Mikasa, and Annie are known as the best and are usually together on most missions. When the whole group is called in for a mission that's supposed to be simple, questions start to arise. Why would they need everyone when there's only one man to kill and who is this group that's constantly following Eren? The Survey Corp is a group of professional hitmen. When out on a mission they run into a teen who is heavily armed and decides to bring him in. What happens when the supposedly cold Levi can't seem to keep his eyes off the gem-eyed brat."
"Based on the Tumblr Post: Levi and Eren get into an argument and harsh things were said. Levi stalks off to their room. He doesn’t bother saying good night to Eren because they’re both really angry with each other. Levi cries himself to sleep, he hates hurting Eren. Eren feels bad and goes to check on him when he’s asleep and sees the tear marks down his cheeks. Eren feels guilty so he hugs Levi the whole night. Levi wakes up because it’s usually so cold, why it is so warm, and finds Eren curled up against him and smiles. Everything’s okay again. I kinda tweaked the prompt a bit, but it's still full of angst and fluff! Sorry for the sucky summary, there is a longer one inside but it was too long to put here..."

"“Hey, Levi, are you sure this is what you want?” Levi glares up at him for a moment, brows furrowed. “What the fuck do you think?” Mike knows what Levi wants, he doesn’t need to ask. It doesn’t happen often, but it’s not the first time Levi has turned up at his door when Erwin is too caught up in saving humanity or whatever the fuck he’s doing, to notice the desperation in Levi’s eyes, the need coursing through his veins. Mike sometimes wonders if he should feel guilty, wonders if he’s taking advantage.  Erwin and Levi are two of his closest friends after all.  But part of him can’t help thinking that if they can’t get their shit together, then tough, they might all be dead tomorrow, so he may as well take his chances.  And fuck, this is Levi, no one takes advantage of Levi unless he wants it. An angsty, smutty, Mikeri one shot."

"Eren Jäger, a rapidly uprising star in the world of figure skating, meets Levi Ackermann, the unsurpassed champion in this devision of ice and cold.

"A one night stand and three months later, Eren finds out that he is pregnant with Levi's child, yet Levi is nowhere to be seen.  Levi left Eren alone with the responsibility of a child.  As Eren cleans up his life for the sake of his unborn baby, he comes face to face with the man who broke his heart once again.  Things spiral out of control and make no rational sense, but since when has there ever been reason in Eren and Levi's relationship? *This work is also published on Wattpad under TheAnimeNerd17 with Tornadoiris*"
"The chain dragged Hanji’s vehicle mercilessly forward. The armored car to which it was attached showed no signs of stopping. He looked forward again. The edge was visible. It was lined with rough and ragged rocks. She had to get out. Leaning out, he extended his hand. “Hanji!” Abandoning her tenuous grip on the wheel, Hanji crawled across the seat. She reached out. Their fingers brushed. The chain groaned. Behind her, the Wistvern car spun, losing traction on the thinning sand. Beneath those dirty goggles, he could see brown eyes. For a fraction of a second, he saw nothing else. And then her car jerked back, caught up with the Wistvern car sliding over the edge. His fingers closed over empty air."
"Levi was the son of a barbaric King. One who had his own sense of justice, based on chance. He thought, if you were truly innocent, the odds would be in your favor right? The gods would always provide freedom to one who had done no wrong! That's why, instead of a trial, the accused party would have to pick between two large doors in an arena. One door contained someone beautiful and single for the accused to be married to on the spot. They would be acquitted of all crimes, even if they admitted guilt. The other door contained a hungry tiger, starved for days on end. The tiger would tear the accused apart, not heeding to reason or innocence. And at every trial, Levi sat on his throne alongside his King, looking on at the proceedings with cold eyes and a sophisticated demeanor. For in truth, the young prince was just as barbaric as the one he called ""Father"". *** Based on The Lady or the Tiger (a short story by Frank Stockton)"
"Eren was living a normal life until one day a sickly virus began to spread. It happened quicker then the blink of an eye and no one was prepared. After being kicked out of the Sina Emergency Center, Eren, Levi and friends are forced to do what it takes to survive."
"When Eren met Levi he developed a crush on him and even confessed to him; the confession resulting in a rejection. However, that was not the end for both of them - which Eren had thought - because Levi offered him to become fuck buddies—having sex without any feelings. Eren was okay with that, as long as he would stay by Levi's side. The important question, though, arose faster than Eren wanted to admit. How long could he endure that one-sided love? Now with fic art here and here ! P.S.: NOT DISCONTINUED! Slow updates."
"Levi clicked his tongue at the thought of him not being able to survive in the woods. He was a born survivor – had taken care of himself from an age earlier than most, and definitely did NOT need Erwin’s rather overly concerned tone after everything that had happened. With a smirk, Levi told Erwin that he thought he’d manage just fine. “I’m not leaving, Erwin, it’s called a temporary absence for a fucking reason. Speaking of which, do you mind if I finally leave, or do you have more mothering to get out of your damn system first?” Erwin chuckled. “Fine, fine. Get out of here. Hanji and I will see you in a couple of weeks or so.” The two men shook hands and Levi strode out of the headquarters of Wolfe and Mann, Bail Enforcement Agents, slight limp still apparent in his stride. Levi takes a well-earned vacation in the woods and finds more than he ever expected."

Jean has had it hard ever since kid and had to learn to live a difficult life filled with struggles and needs, but now it's time to bite the bitch right where it hurt. This was payback time."
"In a universe where you would not age without your soulmate, Levi Ackerman was old as fuck. Not in the 'oh, I'm 40, time to start planning retirement' way, more of the 'I was there when Columbus discovered America,' way. And why is this? Well, when your soul mate keeps dying.... You get used to being patient."
"Lieutenant-Sergeant Ella Saddoris (The Demon of the Scouts and Humanity's Vengeance) of the Recon Corp might be one of the most famous soldiers during the Titan Era two-thousand years ago.

If you like emotional rollercoasters full of fluff and angst, this story is for you."
"After shifting into a titan to protect Armin and Mikasa from canon fire, Eren is kept in a cell under the detainment of the Survey Corps, not expecting captain Levi to come and visit him every night and even give him more than he bargained for. But love is a dangerous game in the military, and once a secret is out... There are always consequences."

"Love was blind, love was stupid. In all honesty, love was paralyzing. But it was also protecting and caring, gentle and warm.

Were you tiring of the possessive nature, dominant personality? Ready to be normal again? Was he starting to wonder if it was bordering on unnecessary cruelty? Maybe. Maybe not.

Of course, with a father as rich as his own waiting for him in New York, he wasn't about to turn down a ticket on the unsinkable ship. But on April 8th, 1912, he meets a boy around his age trying to sell many of his valuables just to get a ticket so that his entire family would be able to make the one way trip to America. Taking pity on the freckle faced boy, Jean decided to help him out a little and the two end up on the ship of dreams together. Over the course of four days, Jean faces what he believes is his worst fear at the time, coming to terms with who he is.

However, in the early morning of April 15th, 1912, all of his earlier fears didn't seem so scary anymore. The unsinkable ship, was sinking."
"If I had to be honest, nothing had ever gone right to start with. If you ask me to look back upon a happy time, I wouldn't be able to tell you.

His works tell forbidden tales of man-eating giants, the very same monsters that terrorise every waking moment of his life. He suffers from lucid hallucinations of people who don’t exist; friends he’s never had and carnivorous giants that couldn’t belong to this world. He believed he was insane; that it was only a matter of time before he was locked up in a padded cell. That is until, under a little less than normal circumstances, he is introduced to a raven-haired teen, whose bark is just as bad as his bite. Memories begin to resurface; friends are reacquainted; truths are uncovered, and Eren Jaeger learns there is more to him – and more to the past – than he could have ever imagined.

Poems, verses, lines, fragments. Levi finds the fragments, scattered among the papers littering Erwin’s desk.

Preferably with Eren in it with him, but at this point any option was a good one as long as he was out of here. And he could maybe catch up on new episodes of their shows and cuddle with Eren for a bit. Not argue in a much too heated and stuffy downtown restaurant with guns pointed at their heads as they pointed their own at the rival gang leader that stood before them, watching their conversation in confusion and a hint of fear."

The only people who join are people who can't fit into modern society. It's been Eren's dream to join since childhood.  Flunking out of school prevents him from attending military college, and he drifts along in life, ignoring his friends' encouragement to go back to school or start a career. Levi is the gatekeeper of the Northern Gate, the most important (and most troublesome) gate that keeps the human world safe from interference and invasion.  When he receives a letter from his cousin asking him to take on her friend for a summer apprenticeship he agrees against his better judgement. Neither of them is expecting the end of the world."

Life didn't change for everyone, but it changed for Eren, who after his mother's death, father's disappearance, and orphanage's neglect, is finally forced into slavery and prostitution. After a year of unspeakable torture he's put for sale to a private owner. The boy expected a lot, but not to become a help for a disabled ex-professor, Levi Ackerman, and definitely not to be treated like a human again.

She starts a journey to discover the truth about her biological parents that gave her up for adoption when she was a baby. This journey will guide her to cross paths with someone as broken as her, someone that hates her to death for what her biological family did to him.

"The sea. That’s what they reminded her of. Eren Jaeger’s sea-green eyes had enraptured Red from the moment she met him. They shifted like water, with the ability to glide smoothly across quiet winter beaches or summon destructive tempests of rage and fury. There was only one problem. Namely that Eren’s sister/stalker/psycho-girlfriend was NOT okay with Red’s little crush. The two headstrong girls did not clash well, but perhaps the tides of intense hatred can finally wear down their hardened hearts of rock. Slowly, Red begins to notice the way Mikasa fights, as if every battle is one that she would give her life for to protect Eren. The way she nibbles on her last chunk of bread, wanting to savor every last bite. And what are those weird . . . tingly feelings in her gut whenever Mikasa looks in her direction? Red is forced to question herself, her rivalry, and just who the hell her crush was. It was Eren . . . right?"

"Pieck was not a fool. She knew that Zeke had his secrets, things he held close to his heart, tucked away under the cover of darkness.

"Marco didn’t know why he wasn’t more scared.

"It was a little hard to be Marco's best friend when he came out. Not because I didn't like that he was gay—I could care less who he was attracted to—but because everyone in school thought we were dating.

I didn't even think about my sexuality. I liked girls. I was attracted to women. There wasn't anything else to consider."

She couldn’t have come after him again, not after so long. His voice came out as a gasp, “Ida?” She paused for a moment, and then slowly peeled off the mask.

During those fifteen long years, there’s late nights in Eren’s basement, self-exploration, several failed relationships, and plenty of hints that they should’ve just talked about their feelings for each other.

But he refused, not when each time he submitted to the darkness he had hazy visions that came in red and nightmares that brought him guilt waiting for him.

"Levi didn’t know how much more of this he could take. The countless lives he had ended…for what? To learn a little more about this mystery of a world? Bullshit. This was all bullshit. This world was good for one thing: pain and suffering. And that was all you needed to know about it.  The voices screamed louder and louder. He felt like his head was going to expl- “Levi...? Are you alright?” a higher-pitched voice called to him. Ah, that’s right. He still had him. The one he could proudly call his lover.

Love fades, it deteriorates at the edges, folded, bent so many times so that they can no longer recognize that love. Though the opposite of love is not hate, it is indifference. - Or: AU where Mikasa and Eren have an arranged marriage but lost their childhood love for each other."
"Hilda and Levi both agreed to put the duties to the people in front of the duties to each other.

"Mikasa Ackerman didn't understand why she had vague memories of events that couldn't have possibly happened in her life. It was Shiganshina, in the year 845. There was no way those could've happened when she'd been living the same boring life inside the looming walls for the past ten years. But her headaches were getting more frequent by the day, and her dreams were always about the same thing: the echoing screams, the loud thuds of heavy footsteps, the smell of iron that hung in the air, and the death of her friend, Eren Yeager. She didn't understand why she always had vague memories of events that couldn't have possibly happened in her life. Until she was faced again with the echoing screams, the loud heavy footsteps, the smell of blood, and the death of Eren. And then she woke up. She was in Shiganshina, and the year was 845.

"It happens like this: he’s sprinting through the streets of Marley, past the astonished eyes of the people whose lives he’s torn asunder, past the children darting through the streets like they did so long ago in Shiganshina, past the weight of the sins he bears, her small hands in his. They run and run and run, hand-in-hand, and for a moment, the world warps to back when they were nine years old. He grabs her hand. Wraps a red scarf around her neck. And as it flaps in the wind, the ribbon tying their fates together, he leads her home. Anywhere is fine. As long as it’s away from here. Eren, Mikasa, and waking from a long dream."

"The two are a picture together, really odd to the eye. Levi stands shrunken and offensive, ready to gauge out the eyes of anyone who dares get too close. Furlan’s been on the blunt end of that, been on the opposing side before stepping under Levi’s wingspan. It was a shield all these years, from the fear, the pain, the unknown of what each day, and it took countless acts of trust and devotion to get there. Like a trail of breadcrumbs left for a bird, trying to earn even a fraction of its gratitude just for a moment, and Levi’s a crow; dark as night and quicker than death. Erwin is something else entirely, all sunlight and power- the kind that comes from the mind and not the muscle, towering over Levi with the type of integrity he’s never seen before- if he’s ever been lucky enough to see any at all. His arms are the framework for a cage, grand in design and beautiful enough to trick you into thinking all that bronze and light is welcoming, like you want to be his prisoner. Levi’s falling for it, without even so much as a fight despite them being polar opposites. Erwin is gold against Levi’s steel, malleable in skill but sought out and valued. And it makes Furlan fucking sick."

A modern The Yellow Wallpaper (by Charlotte Perkins Gilman) AU where Eren's family move into an old estate over the summer while Eren recovers from his mental illness. What they don't realize is that the wallpaper in the basement tempts Eren's fragile mentality to fall over the edge."
"He was your bodyguard, a dear childhood friend. And you were a princess with obligations after obligations to command. But you knew that love and lust would eventually get in the way between your platonic relationship with the raven-haired."

"Levi discovers something familiar in Eren Jaeger."
"Both followed their respective parents' paths by devoting their lives to the same professions. Erwin teaches history in a small school in Shiganshina; Levi is a prostitute who did everything he could to get out of that hell called Underground. One cold winter night inside the walls, they meet each other. During seven nights of shared intimacy, they reflect on their lives, their choices, and how they ended up becoming what they are.

"While Eren is in Marley, he wonders if Armin is looking at the same star as him."
"“He’s weird, isn’t he?” a hushed whisper said. Levi stopped in his tracks, curious. “The accident made him this way, didn’t it?” “I heard he talks weird now. Eren-” “Ahem” the three cadets jumped so high that Levi thought they’d make contact with the HQ ceiling. “What’re we talking about today?” He said, his arms crossed across his chest. “N-nothing s-sir!” the red-headed woman said. All three salute Levi in a hurry."
"“...Levi? Wake up, sweetie. I have to go to work soon, and I wanted to do something with you.” Levi groans, rubbing his eyes. “Huh…?” “Come on! Get up, get up!” He squints and rises, turning to look at her, eyes hazy with sleep. He yawns while she takes the time to smooth his hair out. “...So what did you want to do?” She grins at him. He looks up at her, intrigued, before she pulls him into a hug, kissing his head. Levi's life with his mom before living with Kenny."
"Armin disagreed with the idea of moving in with Eren because he knew it would ruin their friendship. But after you make out with your best friend, drunk at a party, how are you able to fix that? Unfortunately for Eren, making out and sharing an apartment with his hopefully soon to be boyfriend, was the least of his concerns after he learned how hard it truly was to live with Armin. He found out more things about Armin he had ever wished to. As protective as Eren is, Armin wishes he wasn’t sometimes. ~ Armin doesn’t want to move in with Eren because he’s a little afraid that Eren may realize the things his ex has done to him. After eighteen long months of waiting just to get free, Armin was able to leave the relationship with few regrets. His biggest fear? Eren finds out everything from their high school days and early college years. Now they’re in their second year of college and being 19 and 20 is hard when living on your own so Eren suggested they live together while Armin goes to college and Eren supports the two with his job. Seems oddly domestic and only brings fear to Armin’s world. What if Eren found out more than he wanted? ~ Estimated update: Aug 25 OR Sep 12"
"Addie lives a secluded life as a hermit and genuinely cares about creatures and other beings that make up the world, so when she hears a farmer talk about potentially putting down an unruly bullman before its normal time, she decides to buy him. She takes him home to live with her and provides him with a much better life. She doesn't expect anything from him, but he helps her around the land and they become close. Perhaps too close."
"The moment that their eyes locked, Levi’s heart stood still. Not once in his wildest dreams did he believe that one day he'd be staring into the eyes of the most beautiful monster he’d fallen in love with so many years ago. Reuniting with the one person who knew how to spark fire inside his soul, who looked at him with the vastness of the ocean in his eyes, who Levi understood better than he understood himself—it had all been a fantasy he’d built up inside his head, one he never thought to be possible. Except it was , and his one true love was standing just out of arm's length. All he had to do was take a step forward and reach for him."

"July 2312. A deer stood in the woods. A companion by its side foraging upon the wilderness. A rock hit the tree stump beside them, and a breeze of wind raced through the space between the animal’s ears. They ran. ----------------------------------------------- Eren Jeager thought that he was afraid of dying, that he’d face death and the facade would crumble beneath him and leave him broken and bent. However, upon encountering his end, he felt nothing. A classic sort of numb was the only thing that coerced through his bones. He just wanted to feel something, if only for a split second before he had to fight for his life. He didn’t know he’d cause everything to burn to the ground, much less fall in love. ------------------------ AKA The Hunger Games AU"
"In where Squad Levi survives the 57th expedition. Most of them, at least."
"Modern AU With her father's health in decline, Pieck has begun to withdraw from herself. She's more quiet and lonely, however will one boy with mismatched hues be her knight in shining armour and bring the light back into her life?"
"Eren is a professor with a troubled past he'd prefer to keep hidden, Levi is one of his students who's made it his goal to make the brunette his. As an unforeseen event pushes them closer together will they find the happy ending they both so desperately want or will the past be too much for one of them to overcome? As secrets are shared and bonds are formed, when actions speak louder than words ever could, there's only one unanswered question that remains: When morning comes will you still be there?"
"After Mikasa left, Eren re-started everything from the beginning.

"Levi was never one to express his feelings, not even to those closest to him. Yet he had a stash of notebooks filled with his thoughts. What happens when Eren's curiosity gets the better of him and he finds something revealing the true mind of the World's Strongest?"
"idk just a drabble i thought of"
"“what do you mean i can’t be a stripper and an agent??” “uhh, it’s not appropriate” “I get 2 jobs, have some fun, and you in return get another place to get drunk and find the ‘bag guys’” “no- uh, let me think and talk to-” “get it done quickly or you lose me, i need some fun in my life, so i either do both or leave.” — being an undercover agent for a big business or drug ordeal and money laundering wasn’t what you had in mind when you left for the city. but when you find yourself short in money, exotic dancing and letting loose in an expensive night club, you soon find yourself getting richer but also getting in deeper trouble, “but i like wearing my costumes!!”"
"Eager to break free from the stigmatization and a painful past, Levi and his friends, Isabel and Farlan, have fled their pack, leaving behind them a growing tension as well as bitter memories. After weeks of walk, the trio end their journey when they encounter, in a rather rough meeting, a pack located within the Alps, forming a small village of cabins. Erwin, the young Alpha, soon to be leader of the pack of the Alps, tries his best to convice his dad to allow Levi and his friends to remain with them, even if the later share a deep hatred for the young alpha. And the feeling is requited, thank you very much."
"""Oh man, its been awhile hasn't it? Are you just as excited as I am? 'Cause I've been dying to see you."" Born in Liberio, [Y/N] was one of the few selected for the Warrior Unit. A new titan was bestowed upon you- a secret weapon of the Eldian army and kept as a last resort in times of dire need. Sent to Paradis island with the original four, your mission was set on finding the Attack Titan and returned to Marleyan hands. However, after everything went awry, you were tasked with delivering the 104th Corp to the hands of the Eldian army. The only issue is that, the Royal Government was tipped in recent years that the Marleyans had a secret Titan. Upon reallocating Survey Corp and 104th Regiment Cadet records, they started to tie the strings together. It becomes a race against time to capture you and force your untimely demise- or an initiation of all out war against Paradis Island and Marleyan Government."

"The third part to ""You Deserve the World,"" this time exploring the rescue of Paradis Levi. “Hange, we can’t just send him back to Marley,” Erwin argued, “Do you know what they do to him there?” Hange bit their lip and looked away from him, “Listen, Erwin. I’m sure it’s very sad how they treat him. But he’s not ours. We already have our own Levi, and we’re failing him by not bringing him back through a negotiation with the Levi we have!” Erwin frowned, knowing they were right. He’d been putting off contacting Marley for a trade simply because he’d been trying to figure out how to keep Marley Levi with him. In doing so, who knows what further torture Paradis Levi had had to endure because of him. It made Erwin sick to his stomach."
"Levi has never cared about the no-dating policy of the publishing company he works at. Romantic love doesn't have a place in his life anymore, it passed away many years ago, its dying seeds the only proof of its existence. But when a new intern joins his team of editors, he is forced to face a past he hasn't been able to move on from, realising in the process that the roots in his heart still haven't dried out; they are just waiting for the winter to pass."
"jean kirstein is using you, and it's starting to feel like all you know is to be used."
"He never looked. Not once. Once he looked, it became real. He would have to face what he was and his perfect image of Levi as his righteous patron saint would be destroyed. As it was now, he could look away and act as if it wasn’t there. He couldn’t see it so it wasn’t real. It wasn’t his fault. Not my fault. Not my fault. Not my fault. A mantra he repeated over and over. His mind folding in on itself. Hugging it’s knees to it’s chest and rocking back and forth and all he could think was. Not my fault. Not my-"
"After battling the female titan in Trost, Levi and Erwin take advantage of a brief moment's rest to regroup."
"Ever since Levi came back from the 57th Expedition he's felt off. He's angrier than normal, and he can't seem to get even the tiny amount of sleep he's accustomed to. The reality of what's causing these things to happen to him is something that he's not quite ready to accept."
"The fourth part to ""You Deserve the World,"" this time exploring the relationship between Paradis Levi & Paradis Erwin. “Erwin?” Levi said softly. “Yes, my love?” “I think... I think we should try it,” Levi spoke in a quiet voice, as if he was scared of what he was saying, “You know... sex.”"

In which Levi was captured and brought to Liberio, where Marleyan Erwin broke him. He was subjected to torture, sexual assault, and cruel experiments in order to extort valuable information out of him. He was waiting to be rescued by Paradis Erwin and his comrades, unbeknownst to him that he was considered a condemned traitor back there. But how will Paradis Erwin punish Levi for his treacherous actions?"
"The knowledge of who’ll come for you, that deep, resounding fear nestling in the corners of your mind, haunts you. He’ll be here. Soon. He likes taking his time. Making you shiver, shake, cry, tremble. And for that, you hate him."
"Five bodies, each of them another trauma added to Levi's ever growing collection. After Petra's father stopped him on the way back into Wall Rose, Levi couldn't take it. he composed himself, and continued on. Going through the motions, memorials, funerals, talking to family. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. He's been through it a thousand times, not once is it easier. (might not have more chapters)"
"9 years ago, Eren left this world behind. Now, he returns and things will have to irrevocably change."
"It's your senior year at Sina high and you're going to make the most of it with your friend group Eren, Mikasa, Armin, Jean, Connie, and Sasha. You've always had a thing for Eren but vowed to never tell him how you feel until one night... TW: drugs, drinking, abuse, swearing, smut, cringe (my writing improves as you go bear with me)"
"It's finally summer break and you decide to let go and fuck around with your friends. who knew it would be interrupted with jealous exes and drunken dads (my writing improves as you go bear with me)"
"“Haven’t you heard? The king has announced his engagement! Everyone in the kingdom is celebrating tonight. We’re finally going to have a queen!” Levi watched Farlan’s eyes sparkle with excitement and knew his were wretchedly dull in comparison. Dull, grey, flat. Not beautiful, pretty, or something to be admired. Those were words used to describe women, not him. Not him, with his corded muscle and the patchwork of scars burned white across his chest. Not him with his constant glare and his inability to smile without looking manic. “Well, I’ll make sure to send my congratulations to the king.” ~~~ Levi was just hungry- he certainly didn’t ask for the Prince of all Eldia to take an interest in him. And he certainly didn’t ask for the hell that followed."
"Then all at once I know; I shouldn’t feel like this, I shouldn’t be this worried, but I am.  It’s not the task at hand that is keeping me here, it’s what I might find if I leave.  If I ask the commander, he won’t go.  If I ask Hanji, she won’t leave.  It has to be me, it has to be me."
"In wich Levi is (completely out of character) really confused about his feelings and has absolutely no idea how to deal with them so he resorts to going into a bathroom and crying like a baby, while simitaneously making Eren confused as hell. ~~ Levi had to take a moment, to just get a hold of himself. Because sweet Sina, save him. That was Eren Yeager, the litteraly man of Levi's dreams, sleeping peacefully -and gracefully mind him- on the other side of Levi's bed. He cursed himself silently. He had always told himself he would never let people get close after Isabel and Farlan died. Yet here he was, trying not to have his skin melt off of his face because this brunette brat of a Titan Shifter had gone and made Levi's little, dark, stone cold, shrivelled up heart beat so fast Levi felt like he may as well have run right from wall Maria to Wall Sina then back again. ~~ He gulped again and tore his eyes away from Eren's and managed to stand up fully. He was about to turn and just walk back to the bathroom but he chucked one last glance at Eren and froze up all over again - stuff this last glance bullshit why didn't Levi just turn around."
"‘What have you done to yourself now,’ he said. No one else but Erwin heard him add, ‘You fucking fool.’"
