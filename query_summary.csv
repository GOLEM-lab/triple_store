"The Harry Potter- Attack on Titan crossover no one asked for. except for one needy hoe. TL;DR When a persistant idiot and a blind hot-head, cause nothing but stress for each other, there seems but one way for them to channel their hatred into.

'Til the end."" A drunken promise between barely-friends, a desperate attempt to find some stability in a world of endless pain. Through the obscurity of it all one thing makes sense to him; Levi cannot fathom a version of this reality in which you do not exist, and he would sacrifice anything, damn the titans and everything else with them, to preserve your existence. He cannot begin to find the words to express this fundamental need for you, above all others, to stay alive. This feeling is untranslatable. All he can do is grip his glass a little tighter, bite down on his teeth, and swallow everything left unsaid. That's how it's always been between you both, a locked chest of unsaid things, a lexical gap of a relationship, and that's how Levi is determined to keep it.

"Basically a Levi x Reader but also kinda not (if that makes sense lol), it was just easier for this story to not use a Y/n. The twin sister of Eren Yeager follows her brother's story with a few extra twists and turns and, of course, a romance with Levi Ackerman. Now that I've really gotten into writing it I can say that this story contains: sibling fluff, angst, and some pretty major daddy issues. This story does not follow the AoT timeline fully and the character's ages are different. That being said, there is quite a big age gap between Levi and the reader or mc (whatever you want to call it). Although no romance will happen between them before she is 18. She does however have a romance before Levi that is pretty crucial to the story, this will happen before she is 18 though. Some parts of this story might need a TW, but I'll always put that before hand. There will be lemons later on in the story and mature themes throughout it. I do not own any of the AoT characters!"

He‚Äôs confused and scared and a little creeped out with the way that Armin is holding him but he decides that it‚Äôs better than him being left even though he knows that‚Äôs what should have happened. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to tell anyone, I changed my mind.

"It took months for Jean to finally accept his best friend‚Äôs death. Then it took years for him to move on, if one could even say he ever really did.

Afterwards when Erwin assured he would stay, was dedicated to helping Eren get and do better, Armin gave his stamp of approval.

They‚Äôd been dating Armin long before they made it official."
"‚Äú....You ate her‚Ä¶.‚Äù Grisha didn‚Äôt need the body to know that the mass pile of blood the child was sitting on that caked his skin and hair to know that it had been his test subject that was the vessel to his live experiment. Eren didn‚Äôt respond to him, he had a feeling Grisha had been expecting it for some time now.

Now he is 20, and ready to take over his kingdom. But in order for that to happen he has to take an omega and complete the mating ritual. Rod Reiss, his regent, seems more than happy to give over control to the prince, but underneath that facade he is scheming away to make it so that he continues to have control over the capital. Levi is an omega who basically grew up with Eren. His uncle, Kenny, ran one of the most prestigious omega houses in the country and had a close relationship with Rod. So Levi was often at the castle, until he presented as an omega that is. Once he did, Kenny locked him in a room, never to be touched. Now about 10 years later, he is being presented to Eren as his mate, but how far will rod go to secure his place on the throne."

Everything had been going far too well, so it only makes sense that when you‚Äôre reaching record breaking distances beyond Wall Rose that it all goes to shit. Could you blame them really? Leaving you behind? Assessing the sharp point of your femur poking through your thigh you decide, yeah, you could blame them a little.

"Hitch Dreyse‚Äôs life has always been blank and colorless. Ever since she remembers, Hitch sees the world in black and white, which has forced her to grow up with a sense of apathy, in line with the ugliness of that reality. She doesn‚Äôt care about the boring grayness surrounding her. However, things start to change when the odd, fellow comrade Marlo Freudenberg enters her life. Soulmate What If. Not an AU ‚Äì they are still in the Military Police."
"Eren wakes up Armin one night after returning from the battle at Marley."
"The night before Shiganshina, the middle of the battle, and the aftermath. Levi would follow Erwin anywhere - meaning the choice to let him go where Levi cannot yet follow is the hardest battle of all."
"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶as soon as I‚Äôm done and you have to go home‚Ä¶I‚Äôm right back out there again, begging for spare change in the cold. I never should have followed you in here; it will just make it harder to go back.‚Äù ‚ÄúWho said anything about leaving you out there again?‚Äù"

"A blind date can go very wrong... or maybe not so much. A match on Tinder could start a really intriguing story, or be the headline of a tragedy in the news.

"The world is cruel, but it is also beautiful. This is a lesson Faye Jeager learnt from a young age, and one she strives to teach to what is left of humanity. Faye‚Äôs fascination with the birds that flew over the walls of her small part of the world had her mesmerised since birth and served as the drive she needed to make it as a leader of a secret underground society. For a while, serving justice from the shadows was enough. But in a world as fragile as this, change can be brought about by a mere grain of sand. The fall of wall Maria would eventually bring death to what remained of humanity. Faye‚Äôs last promise to her mother was to keep Eren safe, even if it meant following him to the ends of the earth.

"Levi was sick of it, and he was so fucking tired. But they had to shoulder it all and move forward.

The room was dark, the only source of light being the occasional bolt of electricity. ‚ÄúSometimes‚Ä¶.‚Äù ‚ÄúSometimes?‚Äù you lift the bottom of his shirt, tracing his back with light and gentle touches. He sighs and leans his head back, his hair brushing your face. He still wasn‚Äôt looking at you. You kiss his shoulder. ‚ÄúEren look at me and tell me what‚Äôs wrong.‚Äù He turns his body, facing you. ‚ÄúY/N.‚Äù You move to speak but he puts a finger on your mouth silencing you. ‚ÄúI wish I had never married you.‚Äù"

"‚ÄúErwin and Levi were the only two ‚ÄúIsland Devils‚Äù held captive in Marley, so they were both subjected to lots of hate, but Levi more so. Not only was he an Island Devil, he was an Ackerman. Erwin was sometimes spared from some of the more violent treatment because of his disability, but Levi was subjected to double. In order to beat him down, the Marleyans (and even some of their fellow Eldians) manipulated him, isolated him, tried to get him to hate both Erwin and himself. They called him a dog. According to them, none of his choices were truly his own. Every breath he drew was in order to please Erwin. ‚ÄúYou really think he actually cares about you? You‚Äôre the most miserable dick I‚Äôve ever met; he‚Äôs obviously just using you, and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it. I almost feel bad for you. Tell me, Ackerman, how does it feel to spend your entire life living as another man‚Äôs bitch?‚Äù Levi and Erwin were both captured during the return to Shiganshina. They have spent the last four years as prisoners of war in Marley."
"The frigid and unforgiving streets of the city were never a proper place for any person to grieve. The only solace she could find was within the tune of plucking strings. Those were the only moments she could escape the harrowing world around her. Each song, each note, made her long to leave her current reality. The deluge of a bizarre rainstorm would soon grant those endless wishes an opportunity; amongst giants and walls. Could this new life, in a new world, be the blinding light in her darkest tunnel?"

"‚ÄúWell, if you get cold, let me know.‚Äù The words hung in the air between them and Jean nodded even though he was not certain he heard Marco correctly. Let him know? What exactly would Marco do in the event that Jean was too cold? Jean‚Äôs fists dug into the fabric of the tent floor. He wanted to hear Marco say what he was implying. Wanted to hear him say that he would use his body heat to warm him. The physical closeness that would require made Jean‚Äôs stomach hurt. Under no circumstances would he admit he was cold, no matter what. He would absolutely make a fool of himself, he was certain."
"And really, the game wasn't in Jean's interest at all. He had been dragged by his friends to this stupid place where he was doomed to an eternity of obnoxious hormonal teenage girls and greasy fast food that smelled awful. He could swear nothing caught his eye, not even the flustered lanky boy with pitch black hair and flushed cheeks that accentuated the brownish freckles scattered over his face. Well, maybe that wasn't totally true. Or the one in where Jean meets Marco at a football game and has a hard time trying to convice his friends (and himself) that he is straight, even though he knows he's balls deep. Pun intended."

"If the days were bad, the nights were even worse. Levi‚Äôs Eren-mania bled into the dark of his room as the image of Eren crept into his unwilling mind. He was haunted by the memory of Eren looking at him so desperately that night, as if all he‚Äôd ever wanted was to be close to Levi‚Ä¶ When Eren confesses his love to Captain Levi, Levi is unsure how he feels back but is determined to make sure it doesn‚Äôt go any further for Eren‚Äôs protection.

"Eren Jaeger had always been the louder and more talkative one out of the pair, and being the hotheaded and stubborn man that he was, this trait would occasionally lead to fights between him and his partner, Levi. That was alright, though, because the said fights had never actually caused any permanent damage to their relationship. Given this, they didn't think it was possible that one of their fights would catalyse an incident that would change them forever. That is, of course, until it did."
"Levi hates silence. Rated T for brief description of violence."
"Erwin is everything Levi has ever wanted to be.

Or, the AU inspired by Alexander the Great that no one asked for."
"King Levi Ackerman of Paradis holds little to no interest in anyone or anything which doesn't pose a direct threat to his country. That is until you, the Demon Tsar of Dimovka, propose an arranged marriage between yourself and Levi's adopted brother in order to adjoin the two countries in a lasting peace treaty (and to weasel your way into overthrowing another country he suspects). After that, Levi is much more interested in the empire of Dimovka, a certain infamous Imperator who rules over it, and ending the arranged marriage before you can sink your teeth into his country."
"She‚Äôll stay tonight. For the first time, she‚Äôll stay with me. The world was cold and cruel, a fact you were well accustomed to, and it was rare to find moments of solace. But with her around, it felt like that‚Äôs all the world would ever offer. Warmth and solace. You couldn‚Äôt stop the large grin that crept its way onto your face, absentmindedly drawing circles on her shoulder as you focused on the sounds of your breaths coming into sync. Though that didn‚Äôt last, as she eventually untangled herself to slowly make her way off the bed. You found your mouth clamped shut, the spring flowers once-blooming in your chest now withered away as your false hope was revealed to be nothing but that; false hope."

"If there was one thing Jean Kirschtein had learnt from his years spent on the Scouts, was when to resign an already lost battle. As stubborn as he was. And so that morning, when he woke up next to Pieck Finger, he was sure: Everything had changed. Nothing would ever be the same.

Caught up in its demonstration, the two remaining veterans are reminded of an old song thought to be long forgotten from their earlier soldier days.  Levi specifically discovers that music has a way with stirring buried emotions."
"Levi shuddered and wrapped his arms around himself, fighting for some shred of control to contain his emotions, to reschool his face into emptiness. It didn't work, it couldn't. He was too far gone, too far over the edge to possibly climb back up. Warm hands touched his elbows and he flinched away from the touch, eyes clenching tighter. ""Just hit me, beat me, h-hate me. Make it easy for me to hate you, to stop loving you."""
"The world is never fair. I have been dragged through years and years of shit. The underground. Thugs. Titans. For so long I thought I'd had it the worst. Been through the worst. Survived the worst. Then I met Eren Jaeger."
"The loss of light in the colder months isn't the only darkness Levi must contend with this time of year."
"This is loosely based off the song Arcade by Duncan Laurence. The story takes place in season 3 after the fight with the Beast Titan and how emotions are running high. Just a quick piece because I was feeling angsty."

"1. WarHammerTitan Mikasa She was a traitor just like the rest of them, so why wasn't he turning her in to his superiors in while his comrades searched for her all over the base. Why was he listening to her words and letting her get closer and touching her warm skin. The others, he'd raged at, had pledge to them he'd be their deaths. Why couldn't Eren immediately burn this bridge with Mikasa in the same way he'd done with Annie, Reiner, and Bertoldht. There were all fucking traitors. Remember that time I opened my request box?

"We all know the story, it‚Äôs been told to us countless times. Eren and Mikasa run away to a beautiful cabin in the woods in order to enjoy a perfect romance. Of course, that‚Äôs nothing but a pipe dream. The truth is, Eren could never run away and it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault but his own."
"Bertholdt still remembers the story clear as day. He must prevent its reenactment."
"After a breakup, Armin is far from ever wanting to date any time.  He just wants something easy, fun, with no strings attached to distract him from not being boyfriend material.  Thankfully, Jean feels the same. Still feeling down about his own recent breakup, and constantly scrolling through Marco's happy Instagram, Jean thinks that just having fun will help him to get over his ex. Under the one condition that neither of them develop feelings.  What's the worst that can happen? *Friends with benefits Jearmin, updates on Fridays!*"
"A collection of various one shots based on the prompt of the day"
"Bertholdt is dead. Except maybe he's not. Drabble. #ReibertWeek2022"
"Reiner lets Bertholdt comfort him, despite his thoughts."
"For Levi, trying to punch Erwin in the face was some sort of sick attempt at relieving his pain. He was asking for a punishment, and would gratefully accept it. For Erwin, it sparks an arousal that he knows isn't allowed under their professional requirements. It's only a matter of time before everything spirals far out of their control."
"Levi visits the brothel he once lived in, finally confronting the death of his mother."
"Modern!Au where Marco spends his last moments with Jean after a fatal accident. Despite doing that, despite all the memories, both Jean and Marco regretted not doing things they wanted to."
"Eren would love nothing more than to announce to the whole world that he loved Levi Ackerman with all his heart. But he knew they lived in a time, in which their love was forbidden and considered a crime. Levi and Eren shared a passionate love full of feelings and longing that could, however, get them both behind bars or lead to their deaths. Why was this world so cruel to people who were only in love with each other?"
"Sometimes. Every once in a while. Armin finds himself wondering what Annie would've been like if none of this had happened."
"He‚Äôs gorgeous, you‚Äôve always thought so. You touch his cheek with your hand, and he looks up. Tears are streaming down his face; his eyes are red and puffy. Your heart aches for him and you want to hold him. You want to whisper in his ear and tell him it‚Äôs going to be okay. You want ‚Äî ~ Or the one where Levi watches Eren cry (and more)."
"Marley taught them how to kill people and regenerate missing body parts. Marley tutored them on how to become a ruthless murder machine. Marley instructed them to abandon their humanity and carry new wild nature. Marley, however, hasn't told them how to keep their mind together and don't let the trauma take over them. Bertholdt tried, but maybe he wasn't all that strong besides mastering the Colossal Titan instantly."
"Though the crystal was searing hot to those around him, Bertholdt wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable. The inside was gentle and warm, not unlike being wrapped up by a cozy blanket. Nights spent in the bunkhouse snuggled up with Reiner crossed his mind before he slipped off to a deep rest. (During RtS, Reiner and Bertholdt crystallize themselves to save their own lives) (Day 2 of Reibert Week - Canon AU)"
"Levi comes to Erwin for comfort after a long day and Erwin's guilt over Furlan and Isabel's deaths comes to light."
"‚ÄúHe‚Äôs crazy about you, and I get it. You‚Äôre not that girl that somebody wants to lose.‚Äù When you started your new life at college, you hoped it wasn't as bad as your life back in high school. You were in a stable relationship with Jean Kirstein, had your whole life set out in front of you, and were a changed person. But when you find out that Eren Yeager used to go to school with you and knows about everything that happened, it changed your whole plan of how you thought your life would turn out. The real question though was: would it change for the better, or for the worst?"
"Levi let his gaze linger on the engagement ring before finally pulling it off his finger and laying it down on the table. He closed his eyes and felt a single tear slip from the corner of his eye. ""Goodbye, Eren."" - A story about Beta Levi and Alpha Eren, who aren't soulmates and have a relationship that society doesn't approve of. Despite this, they still want to give their love a chance, but what happens when Eren meets his true soulmate?"
"Mikasa and Eren made it through the hardest years of their life together. Mikasa and Eren triumphed together. Mikasa and Eren are there to pick each other up when they fall. It's always been Mikasa and Eren, Eren and Mikasa; but at the same time, it's not. Mikasa and Eren might not have a future together, and as much as she tells herself it's okay, it still hurts like hell."
"A few very short drabbles based on five word prompts that I accepted a while back <3"
"Based on Champagne Problems by Taylor Swift and this is the man's perspective. That's all."
"It's been years. No matter how many, Reiner still remembers, still feels guilt pooling deep in his chest. It doesn't matter now."
"Living a life of luxury, you had never expected your world to be overturned in one night; in just a few hours. From a life filled with balls; extravagant evenings and people falling to their knees at the sound of a mere word to having it all swept from under your feet. You‚Äôre torn away from your world and left to struggle through a world you‚Äôve never seen before: he takes you away from everything. But he doesn‚Äôt just steal you away. He takes you on a journey you never would have had in your world."
"They weren't afraid of the other being disloyal. When Bertholdt left, getting into the carriage and smiling at Reiner from the window oh-so-gently, Braun trusted that even his lover's career could never defeat their devotion. Although, he hasn't questioned how dedicated he could be and how long he could stay independent from his mother's choices."
"As a soldier, Reiner can say he's seen his fair share of atrocities while on duty. He just didn't expect to come home from deployment to the worst one of all; some mysterious virus that had appeared out of nowhere and swept away nearly everything in its path. Now, he roams the ill-named country of Paradis alone, bitter and guarded. After all, there's not much worth fighting for in this ruined world, aside from his own survival and the need for revenge that keeps him going. But maybe that can change. Maybe."
"Wall Maria has just been regained and Eren is feeling fine. After reading the books, finding out about Marley, his father, and his brother. It's all fine. Or so he's fooled himself to believe so. Or, Eren breaks down and Levi is there to help pick up the pieces."

"Seventeen-year-old Jean Kirschtein complains about life, his best friends use him for his car, all the normal high school stuff. It sucks. Being seventeen really, really sucks. Especially when your best friends make you come to a stupid football game. Especially when you see Eren and his hot adopted sister there. Especially when you're starving and go to the food stands, and-- Wow, that guy has a lot of freckles."
"they say absence makes the heart grow fonder. apparently, they were right. they were right because it's been five years since armin last spent a summer with eren. they were right because it's been five years and armin's heart still beats a little faster whenever eren's around. but he can't get attached; he has a degree to earn, a career to pursue, and thousands of miles between them when the summer ends. it's funny how the head and heart never seem to agree, isn't it?"
"Marco Bodt got into a car accident at the age of 16, which resulted in him losing his right arm. Convinced that none of his friends care about him, he moved to another town and learnt to adjust to his new reality. Jean Kirschtein spent the past 2 years in conviction that his best friend wanted nothing to do with him and trying to get used to that. At the age of 19 he thought he'd moved on. Or maybe he just hoped he had. They reunite in college, and it turns both of their seemingly peaceful lives upside down."
"The events at Liberio has left Porco feeling emotionally distraught and physically sick. Riddled with nightmares and plagued with Guilt, Porco begins to struggle through his daily life. With the day to leave for Paradis approaching worryingly fast, can his closest friend and his worst enemy bring him back to his old self again in time for their departure? Basically 4 chapters of angst, hurt comfort and a deep delve into Porco and how much trauma he had to deal with after Eren used him to retrieve the Warhammer.

But there you are, tougher, more cynical, more capable, and with a far more violent gang leader than Levi ever was as your best friend and FWB. Levi wants to apologise, and he wants the love of his life back, but with you pretending you've never met him before, how on earth is he supposed to remind you of how in love the two of you were and win you back from the idiot you arrived with?"

"The aftermath of it all was something Eren knew he was never ready to handle. It's so much easier to sanction his cruel actions all alone. He's come back, but it hardly remedies the irreparable damage that's already been done. After it all he still can't be honest, he thinks the truth might kill him, even though it already feels like he's dying a slow, painful death. It's better this way, isn't it? That he's the only one who gets hurt? But he's not the only one. That's the problem."

"In a world where most of humanity had retreated and hid in the safety of the Walls, Titans reign supreme. But unbeknownst to the people of the Walls, there are threats and creatures lying beyond the horizon far greater than the monsters scraching at their doorstep. Many miles away from their secure gates, there are beings whose mere existance is incomprehensible to their limited knowledge and one-dimentional mindset. Creatures that could easily put humanity to the test or be it's most valued allies that could finally turn the tide in their three-centuries-long war. When their safe-heaven is inevitably destroyed and the world is once again plunged into hell by the creatures' might, it is also up to them to end the cycle and return the world into the peace it had lost on the day the first Titan appeared. Or Eren is Titan shifter living his life and minding his own business outside the Walls. Until one day he somehow gets cought up in a war he never wanted to be apart of and might just be what humanity needs to end this unfortunate conflict. I'm bad at summaries"

"Sometimes the hardest realisation can be that the actions that were taken, logical and justified, are the actions that can plague us with the most guilt.

"Day 4 and 7: Soulmates and Fireflies Gone , Eren‚Äôs mind would cry, his distress like the flares they shot up into the sky, made of black and greens and reds that hurt Levi‚Äôs soul. Always gone. Levi would do his best to soothe him, running fingers through the damp strands of Eren‚Äôs hair and holding him close. He would wrap his body around the other male as he did with his mind, enveloping him in calming blues and grays that Eren lit up like fireworks in his distress. It would hurt, sending pain radiating out through Levi‚Äôs very being as he was invaded with emotion too strong and uncontrolled to be anything else. He would endure it though, because there were far worse things that could happen to him--to them--than a little pain. I‚Äôm here, he would croon, thoughts like a soft melody. Nothing is gone."

There‚Äôs a knock on her door. Mikasa looks out the peephole before stopping. It was dark, and surely no one in this building would try anything.

"Mikasa's mind kept going back to that fateful moment when the very same creepy-smiling titan that had devoured Carla Yeager five years ago was about to finish her and Eren. At that instant, she was convinced it was the end of the line. It had been then that she‚Äôd decided to pour her heart out to him, to not leave this world without letting him know how she truly felt about him‚ÄØ‚Ä¶ so why hadn‚Äôt she? And those bizarre dreams she had afterwards ...  if there was someone in this world that could bear with whatever lunacy had taken over her without judging her, it was Armin."
"‚ÄúMerry Christmas, Mikasa. Good Luck.‚Äù He called out from across the park without sparing her a single glance. Mikasa should have got up and chased after him when she heard him speak again.

"There was always a fleeting moment before they began pummeling each other that made Jean feel something he couldn‚Äôt quantify. In the seconds between their directed insults and the feeling of bleeding knuckles was this curious transition, a glint between them that Jean didn‚Äôt bother to understand, and it walked a line between the definition of fury and the associated feeling of fervor.

"After spending one fateful night in an abandoned cabin in the middle of nowhere, Levi and Eren's lives are drastically changed."
"‚ÄúErwin and Levi were the only two ‚ÄúIsland Devils‚Äù held captive in Marley, so they were both subjected to lots of hate, but Levi more so. Not only was he an Island Devil, he was an Ackerman. Erwin was sometimes spared from some of the more violent treatment because of his disability, but Levi was subjected to double. In order to beat him down, the Marleyans (and even some of their fellow Eldians) manipulated him, isolated him, tried to get him to hate both Erwin and himself. They called him a dog. According to them, none of his choices were truly his own. Every breath he drew was in order to please Erwin. ‚ÄúYou really think he actually cares about you?

He rocks with the waves and tumbles and falls and Levi‚Äôs always there to pick him back up, to nurse his humanity back to health. He sees the stars lining Eren‚Äôs eyes are fading. He sees his boy is fading. And Eren just wants to be good for him-for one last time. He wants him soft and sweet-or anyway Levi will have him. He wants to forget his destiny is doom. He wants to love even though he never learned how. And Levi‚Äôs lips are gently pressed against him and kissing up and down the hollow in his throat. When Levi‚Äôs drunk and his defenses are down and Eren wants to pretend, there's nothing they can do to stop the requiting of themselves."
"There was just something so pure about the way Eren slept, it was like watching clouds move along lazily through the clear sky. It was a memory Armin couldn't bear to lose. He remembers how Eren would mumble his name, how the words curved out of him slowly in sleep, the impact always the same for Armin. He‚Äôd reach out and trace patterns on the palm of Eren‚Äôs hand or he‚Äôd simply sit there in awe, that Eren could produce his name so perfectly. Eren had been so quiet in sleep when he spoke, almost like his words were for Armin alone. He collected them like they were, each one that escaped Eren added to his memories; branded into his skin."
"When the kidnappers came for Mikasa and her mother, her father disrupted their plan, stopping them at the cost of his own life. When the Titans breached the Wall Maria, two women managed to escape and rebuild their lives in another place. But a gruesome fate followed the raven girl, and she still ended up in the Underground a few years later, only this time it was her Ackerman abilities that were valuable to the abductors. As a result, she was forced to learn how to fight with the best trainer the Underground had."
"He wanted to cry out. He wanted to scream into the abyss of his emotions, but the only things he could feel were his shock and the tears running down his face. He could only focus on the lifeless corpse that looked like it had been through several brutalized homocides, and his world fading into black. Armin Arlert woke up in a cold sweat in his own bed. The time read exactly 12:28, and the day was August 14th.. just how it was before. Eren protected Armin from death for years in hopes of being free, and it‚Äôs about time Armin did the same."
"The weight of being Humanity's Last Hope crushes Eren, while all his failures cut him open and bleed him dry. In the frigid darkness, empty and numb, Eren has lost hope in himself, nearly giving up on everything. That is, until Humanity's Strongest shows up to lessen the weight."
"Pain is part of life. Pain is his companion, familiar and ever present. Except for the pain of shame and failure. But maybe that failure would be worth something after all."
"Levi wanted to kiss his lips and see his strong face one last time. Now all he has is his sketchbook filled with memories and fading faces."
"‚ÄúWhen does it end, Eren?‚Äù Armin whispers. ‚ÄúWhere do you draw the line?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy should it stop?‚Äù he growls. ‚ÄúWhy must there be a line?‚Äù Why should it? A world that took her away from him‚Äî a world where she isn‚Äôt allowed to exist isn‚Äôt a world that deserves to continue. OR After losing Mikasa, Eren has gone mad with grief, hellbent on destroying whatever is left of the world. Only for her to turn up alive and made to become one of his wives. AKA The Warlord AU."
"Based on the prompt from a tag: ‚ÄúAnd there were TWO beds, but they fucked anyways.‚Äù After the raid on Liberio, Mikasa must cope with the fallout of losing one of her closest friends over the decisions Eren has made.

"Historia is happy."
"The teen knew his best friend didn‚Äôt see him like that. After all, he saw how Armin looked at Jean, eyes bright and filled with wonder and adoration."
"Erwin looked tired, but in the kind of tiredness that was found in people from Underground. The kind that showed in slow moving limbs, in eyes that knew not how to look up, and in the haunting shadows of gaunt cheeks. On Erwin, it showed in the darkened skin and blue veins under his eyes, a product of the constant sleep deprivation he had endured over the years, sinking slowly into the layers of skin until they were visible signs that only made Erwin look more severe than he already did. And the lines on his forehead, on the edge of his eyes, around his mouth - they all reflected something troubling. A suffering beneath the skin."
"Growing up Eren had always been told what he was supposed to do and how he was supposed to feel. As a child he was incredibly outspoken and deemed himself as the type to ‚Äòlive according to his own rules‚Äô but who is a boy who doesn‚Äôt listen to his own parents? He had always had it in the back of his mind that Mikasa (A girl, around the same age as him, whom his father had taken in when they were young) was the one he was to marry. He cared for her dearly and would protect her at all costs. Eren, Mikasa and another boy, named Armin, were very close. Armin was the boy across the street who‚Äôs known the other two for as long as they could all remember. Together they formed their own trio, a family of contrasting personalities thrown together by circumstance but they fit together well , similarly to pieces of a puzzle. But to eren something had always felt out of the place, he loved their dynamic, the energy all three of them emitted when they were together but as they grew older and him and mikasa grew closer more intimately, their dynamic shifted and the puzzle pieces eren once associated themselves with no longer fit together as they normally should."

You two dated for a while during your second year, but it seemed that both your parental problems and the way it caused you to treat loved ones back in the day before you stopped hating everything about life damaged your relationship with him. He had maybe a thousand girlfriends on top of you, and you had your shared amount of partners, but it always seemed like he moved on easily. Then again, Eren always had masks, laughing and smirking on the outside, and he had always been too proud, and even if he still loved you as much as you loved him, he would never admit it to you, or himself for that matter. He told himself that you were always special in his heart and that you two should do your friendship justice, which was also what he told you. It‚Äôs been a year since you started being friends again, and it was painful, to say the least."

"Hate me, use me, ruin me‚Äî make me forget. Eren Jaeger has lived by that motto ever since the traumatic experience in his childhood that he was blaming himself for. Convinced that he doesn‚Äôt deserve life and love ‚Äì that he is meant to suffer and inflict pain on himself ‚Äì, he vegetates as a spiritless human in his room. If it wasn‚Äôt for his step-brother Levi Ackerman, he would have starved to death years ago. As long as Levi was there, Eren had an anchor that chained him to life. Soon enough Levi realises that his devoted efforts and dedicated love for his step-brother are not enough to prevent a catastrophe from happening that additionally reveals hidden demons of Eren‚Äôs past. If Levi doesn‚Äôt act immediately, a second tragedy is inevitable."
"‚ÄúTake me instead,‚Äù Levi begs desperately to whatever god is out there listening. Mikasa‚Äôs body is already cold. ‚ÄúTake me instead,‚Äù he pleads in a tear-filled voice, his fist clenched into the ground."
"Eren had always loved this particular park. It wasn't too far from home, but it was just far enough that he felt like he was escaping a little from his crappy home life. And... because he was there."
"The sun is bright and shining, and Levi aches.  He tells himself his body is worn out from the excursion, and slowly he puts himself together for the day.  It hurts, still, to think of that empty chair in the great hall.  Erwin hasn‚Äôt been forgotten yet, and that helps keep Levi standing. The report comes out, and Levi prepares himself for the onslaught of anger directed at him.  He doesn‚Äôt expect them to understand, yet as he sees Roy‚Äôs hands quiver around his teacup, he knows that he made the right choice. This world is fucking hell."

"Marco Bodt cries in his sleep. And Jean hates him all the more because he understands."
"Levi is a spy for the government, a trained killer and the best they have. He saves the world all the time, but nothing compares to the love of his life and wife to be. You are Levi's world, he'd do anything for you, even kill a person or make someone 'disappear.' You know that he's a spy, but you have to keep it secret from others which only makes it more exciting. After finally getting married, you and Levi go on a very long honeymoon only to find yourselves in the lap of a man who is a future mission for Levi. A chance encounter allows you to show your social skills and the ability to bullshit your way into things, mainly due to being the adviser to the mayor in your city, the scouts ask you to help Levi in his future missions. Fake identities, risky steals, car chases, old flames, people falling for you and more are faced you and Levi. The two of you rely on each other's strengths and love to work through it all. Who doesn't love a little spy romance?"

"Reader finds out that Levi and Petra are dating and starts to feel a little jealousy. But maybe it‚Äôs not as it seems."
"He wondered who would find him first. Would it be Levi? He was sure it's his watch next. But then it might be Erwin. He likes to walk at night sometimes."
"What do you do when the love of your life vanishes?  Did he leave you?  Is he OK?  And worse ... what do you do when he comes back?"
"He finds her in the messhall, late at night, with a bottle in her hand."
"Eren's been living with an abusive Aunt since he was 9 years old but it's only now that people are staring to notice, particularly, his best friends brother, Levi.

All characters belong to Hajime Isayama."
"In a chaotic world of blood and tears, the emotions of Eren and Mikasa are always being tested to the limit. But there is a fact: no matter what kind of difficulty they have to go through, their feelings will always converge to each other."
"When love is a weakness that gets in the way of your goals, you should discard it."
"When he finally finds him, Eren doesn't remember, Levi does, and it hurts more than he can explain. To be so close yet so far away from him. He could reach out yet never cross the final distance between them. And even though Eren doesn't remember, Levi sees the past reflected in all the small things; in the brown of Eren's favorite belt, in his slight obsession with wing patterns, in the strong crave for freedom, in the way he unconsiously bites his hand out of frustration, in the perfect shade of green he is obsessed with, but mostly in the way Eren looks at him when he thinks he can't see him. Every little thing is a painful reminder that despite all that, Eren doesn't remember."
"Levi has survived in the Underground and fought Titans, not even feeling a hint of fear, but now, when he‚Äôs about to meet Erwin‚Äôs parents, he‚Äôs fucking terrified. Pathetic. He might be a great soldier, but what a shit of a person he is. or Levi muses about a few important moments of the past before going to meet Erwin's parents."
"After being in an abusive relationship for years, Levi is ready to start something new with his assistant, but forgetting about the past isn't always easy."
"If you had asked Eren where he saw himself in five years he definitely wouldn't have said screwing recently divorced grey men in their forties for a living. He always imagined he'd end up in business or something simple, or even an artist if he worked hard enough at it. But adulthood has a funny way of turning things on their head, and Eren certainly wasn't spending his days in a blissful office job. Life had certainly fucked him over with his demanding work hours, overcrowded apartment and shitty string of past relationships. Or relationship to be more precise. Eren's life opens up to the intricate world of art after meeting Levi, a short man with an even shorter temper. He finds himself living in a way he forgot existed and slowly begins to pick up his broken shards. But Eren knows how easy it is for something fragile to shatter once more."
"Christmas was the time of year where joy and festivities took over the city. For some, it was a peaceful time. For others, it was a chaotic time. But, there are those who can feel neither for what is Christmas without feeling warmth by your side. Some may go forever without the comfort of another. But, it is not a mandatory solace. Hanji wants to take that warmth to others, and for one man in particular, she wants to make it a memory."

"Never in a million years did Eren expect his squad to be killed like they were nothing. He blames their death on Annie. Because of her he has to suffer as does his captain. Through the dark times he and his captain are now faced with, perhaps each other's comfort is what could help them. What the boy didn't expect was to develop feelings along the way."

"Eren used to believe that dancers needed music to enhance their moves and performance. But the days of seeing Levi move in complete silence allowed him to marvel at the pure finesse in each movement. And while now he can only see those movements again through a screen, he'll never forget the grace and ease in which the other male moved."
"When Levi starts needing a bit more money to pay rent, he starts looking for new jobs then lands an interesting babysitting job. He then meets Eren Yeager, a loaded, famous doctor in charge of several hospitals all over the districts. Immediately, they both find something interesting about the other and can‚Äôt seem to separate themselves from each other."
"What Levi and Erwin have isn't exclusive, and sometimes it bothers Erwin how much he wishes it was."
"It can break a young girl‚Äôs heart, to dream of things she cannot have."
"Hands tainted with colours of the soul are the same as those whose hands have been painted with the blood of another. In a world of magic and seniority two kingdoms lie across from each other, separated by two large walls marking their defence. But one day humanity received a grim reminder that they lived in fear of the titans- giant monsters revived from spirits or very powerful creatures that many called ‚Äúshifters.‚Äù Legend has it that these shifters lived outside of the walls, hiding away and creating lives of their own but once these walls come crashing down all is lost and trust is scarcer than it had ever been before‚Ä¶"
"An emotional misunderstanding between them, inadvertently caused by Marco, forces Jean and Armin to realise and assess their feelings towards each other."
"His lips brushed against Eren's one last time and he opened his eyes. There he was, standing in front of him, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips. Eren felt his eyes widen and he reached out to touch the man he loved only to see his fingers slip through. He drew his hand back as he stared at him, blinking back tears .. The man's expression looked sad yet at peace, eyes full of love for Humanity's Hope .. He saluted Eren, his right fist over his heart, left fist behind his back before disappearing and finally Eren realized, Levi was never going to come back."
"Levi lived his whole life in a cage. His shackles followed him wherever he went which wasn't far at all. To them he was a test subject. To them he was something they could do whatever with. They could beat him, torture, inject him with unknown fluids, take pictures... By now Levi was use to these harsh terms he called life. Sometimes he'd even embrace the pain, that was all he ever knew after all. But just like children, they get tired of their toys and eventually throw them away. Thus an auction is held. What happens when they decide to sell him? They don't care if he's sold into pieces or whole as long as their pockets are full. Levi however, was use to his life... Now he had the opportunity to be free? A chance to escape. Easy right? He wished. Levi was a frightful yet, very beautiful and elegant creature. His luscious wings attracted many from everywhere. Mutant. That's what he is. People feared him yet lusted for him. So who's the lucky buyer? No other than an ocean eyed brat of course."

"Reiner made an anxious face and went to sit on the ground next to his cousin, putting a hand on Gabi‚Äôs shoulder. He leaned over and pressed a kiss to her temple, Gabi closing her eyes and letting a couple of tears drip out. (Zombie AU)"
"Shortly after Trost, an accident occurred, leaving Jean totally blind in both eyes. Though many would have cast him away as useless, he was still recognized for his skill, and a compromise was reached - he would be allowed to stay in the Survey Corps, as long as he always had an assistant to serve as his eyes. It's a very familiar voice that greets Jean every day, directs him, cares for him, but it's also very painful to hear. It's the sound of his best friend's voice. His best friend, who he had seen lying dead on the streets of Trost."
"The Survey Corps can get a bit lonely some days. Luckily, Jean has his friend to keep him company."
"When he called her name and she looked back at him, he quickly realized that her eyes had the same look as they did a year ago when she stood on stage the day of the reaping and it tied knots in his stomach. It's happening again. She's leaving again. And he's helpless again."
"Everyone's wrist has a timer on when they are predicted to die. Seems simple enough, right? (Originally written for Inktober 2016)"
"Rage and wrath dawn his face, melded with his vicious Alpha and pious identity. Eren Orion Jaeger is one of the most feared men in Cepheus. He is well-known for his murderous hunts, his God-fearing personality, and by a small few - his rather soft relationship with his long-term Omega companion - Levi. After finally being released from prison, Eren ventures into the complexities of being in love, and understanding his violent lifestyle does not make him a suitable mate. Levi denies his advances every year, and with each decline, Eren feels his hollowness growing vacant. In a world where Beta control everything, Levi stands as a perfectionist Omega graduate student majoring in Alpha/Omega Dynamics and Evolution. His research is sensational, though it is continuously rejected and undermined by Beta professors. With his passion beginning to dwindle, his tumultuous relationship with Eren suffers. *updated with pictures :)"
"""This is my body. It was built to kill you. Not to please you, not to satiate you. To kill you."" Mikasa weighs the pros and cons of feeling like a human being, and feeling desire for another person. Bertolt should have weighed them earlier."
"""Who am I, then?"" the man asks, the smallest tilt of his lips upward visible. ‚ÄúYou're Erwin Smith, the 13th commander of the Scouting Legion, a well respected man, an excellent strategist, and the best possible person to be commander after the fall of Wall Maria!"" Eren blurts. ""Is there truly no one else who remembers?"" Erwin questions, and Eren nods to confirm it. No one else remembers, until trouble finds Eren like it always does, and he's saved by a familiar face. Then, everyone starts to remember, and it becomes increasingly difficult to keep his secrets under wraps."
"A romantic dinner date is more than it seems. Eren loves Levi, and no one will get in the way of his love. No one."
"Eren Jaeger is sharp, determined and hard working but doesn't consider himself beautiful or good looking in the least. When he lands his dream job, working at Survey Corp Publications as the Executive Assistant to a high-end Fashion magazine's Editor-in-Chief, his life is turned Topsy-Turvy. All he wants to do is work hard to become an Editor, but his boss Levi seems keen on making his life a living hell. Levi is a notorious playboy who gets what he wants both in and out of the bedroom. As Editer-in-Chief of New York's best selling high-end Fashion Magazine, Levi is forced to work with an overly determined, hot-headed brat with a rat's nest for hair and the most incredible eyes he's ever seen and it's all because of Erwin Smith."
"It's been 4 years since Levi walked away from Eren to fight. The war finally ended, and Levi decides to come back home."
"The constant disheartening unsuccess rate of Levi's Squad missions slowly transformed most of Commander Levi's inferiors - himself included - into bitter caricatures of themselves. The team's frustrations ricocheted off of each other, some being struck deeper and more painful than others, and transformed the Survey Corps into a miserable place to escape from. In Jean's mind, nothing, including Eren's life and his supposed key to saving humanity, was worth fighting for anymore. Priorities inevitably change over time, but Jean's desire to peacefully live away from war with Armin dangerously rebelled against the oath and dedication he pledged to the Survey Corps at fifteen. The fate they chose, or if they decided to leave, would eventually kill them. But...how satisfied would they be if they had never attempted to trial their life away? What extreme measures will they have to take to avoid the Survey Corps' equally as extreme consequences? Not only for their escape, but their sinful status as lovers."
"When I found her she was already far too gone for me to save her."
"Eren and Mikasa are always at odds, their relationship only fracturing further after Eren's betrayal. When given the option to finally open up, fight back, and peel the layers of their relationship- they take it."
"You were different from him, yet cut from the same cloth. And it took someone like you to intrude upon his life and turn everything upside down in order for him to finally heal...

Note: For all the readers who want a simple, quick read - each chapter entitled ‚ÄúA Slip of Emotion:...‚Äù can be read as a one-shot! Meaning that you don‚Äôt have to read one chapter in order to know what‚Äôs going on in the next. The only real difference is that the reader‚Äôs character stays the same, and the stories are more or less in chronological order. If you would like to read every story in order, however, they do all tie together."
"on a night that Erwin is losing grip with his humanity, he confesses to having inappropriate thoughts about Levi. Levi is shocked by this confession and that Erwin would get forceful with him, but before long, he is forced to acknowledge that he might not actually hate it."
"Mikasa and Levi are facing some serious problems."
"Levi has always had the hope of one day finding Eren in this new life. One day it eventually happens, but the man he finds isn‚Äôt the one he remembers. There is something different about him Levi can‚Äôt quite put his fingers on‚Ä¶ but his curiosity might be the first step into a situation Levi won‚Äôt be able to escape."
"` after everything, Levi and Hanji started living together but there was one issue - Levi's overprotectiveness."
"As they juggle the fate of humanity in their hands, the weight of betrayal and lost friendships weigh heavy on the trio's shoulders. Can they find forgiveness? Will Eren and Mikasa reunite? Most importantly, what happens when it's all over?"
"Levi knew finding answers wasn‚Äôt going to be easy, but there was no better place than Yharnam to do that; the town had many secrets, too many to slip under his radar."
"A boy and a girl.

His first love turned out to be a one-sided crush on his best friend, and now he was being asked out by another guy who had just gone through a bad break up of his own. Kissing someone you don‚Äôt even love would be wrong... right?"
"He dreams of when he first met Erwin. Of the first time he killed a man, of the first time he killed a titan, of how it didn't differ that much. Of vast fields of grass and clear skies that made something clench in his chest. He wants neither to sleep nor be awake, but can only pretend for so long."
"An unlikely relationship told in fifty sentences."
"Night by night, the shadows grew darker inside their home and inside their hearts."
"In a world where secondary-genders define you, and countries are ruled by Kings and Queens; Erwin Smith searches for a legendary, destined mate to give him power and stature.

When the two are brought together, it reveals a string of confusion, hurt, betrayal, and adventure. Welcome to; Lost Alliance."
"Levi gave Eren 3 days to calm down and returns home to await Eren's decision. This is the last part of the drabble series."
"My name is Eren Yeager. And I belong to my mistress completely."
"And as her form in the sand became smaller and smaller, I couldn't take my eyes off of this young woman that lightened, like the moon itself, some pitch black years of my life. Erwin, the Scouts leader, was clutching my shoulder, trying to show me some sympathy. The car carried us further, back to the walls, back to the concrete cage, until she became a small dot on the cold, windy beach in September.Life had a dark sense of humor. The driver broke the heavy silence: ""You'll make a great teacher, Levi. And an even better undercover Scout."" ""To teach what, Mike?"" I frowned. ""Some bullshit propaganda the Titan Party allows? Sickening manifestos to justify their gruesome murders? Or should I tell those children what philosophy really means, about free will, equity and liberation, when I know so well they will experience anything but that?"" ""That's what we're fighting for, Levi."" Erwin sighted. I continued to stare at that poor, sad, small dot, that never stopped waving me goodbye. ""I'm really leaving, dear."" I wanted to say to her, as my last words, ""So as to always love In this grief, so marvelous, Of never keeping you. Of never being able to allow this love to leave us dead"""
"The titan's curse isn't the only legacy of Ymir. It is fate, and no matter how hard he tries, Levi cannot escape the fate birthed by his own mother."
"""Eren holds him down, wordlessly, as humanity‚Äôs strongest writhes. Ties his wrists and ankles to keep him still, and resets his leg with one, swift movement.

After a period of time they reconnect--can they make things work out? Note--the first few chapters are going to be when the boys are in middle school (approximately 6-8 grade) and then high school before a time skip. The rating WILL GO UP to EXPLICIT."
"After a treacherous battle, Eren is badly wounded and sent into a coma while under Levi's watch. Mikasa doesn't know how to handle her new-found pain and seeks the comfort of her superior officer."

"Eren was no saint. He hurt people, people he loved and people he didn‚Äôt even know. But all‚Äôs fair in love and war. And he truly thought what he was doing was right, even if he was sacrificing everything. People say peace doesn‚Äôt come without a price. They‚Äôre right . . ."
"The war is over, humanity is expanding, and Erwin finally thanks Levi."
"World-class hitman Levi Ackerman is sent to assassinate the reader, the daughter of a prominent FBI officer. However, after watching her for weeks to learn her routine, Levi seriously wishes that ‚Äútaking her out‚Äù had a vastly different meaning in his field of work. I don‚Äôt know how the world of contract killing works, so to all you hitmen out there reading this, please don‚Äôt come after me if I get the details wrong. Rating and tags may change as further chapters are released."
"They‚Äôre just friends. Friends? Right? Then why does his smile make Jeans heart skip a beat. Deep down he always knew but he realised too late."
"you promised you wouldn't leave. you promised him you wouldn't get hurt. yet, there you were‚Äî gunshots on your body and blood spilling out of your wounds. it wasn't long until levi was breaking down into tears in front of his comrades, all the while regretting the choices made and begging the walls to give you back. every single word reminds him of you, and it hurt him too much. tl;dr: you were dying. right in front of levi's very eyes."
"The Autumn of 1918 saw the rise of the second wave of the Spanish Influenza as well as the fall of World War One. But now, Lance Corporal Levi Ackerman is nothing more than a simple milkman.

They discover a world beyond their wildest dreams, with a chance for a new beginning."
"The one where Levi spent five nights confronting the truth that he had just lost his entire squad. That he had lost her. And the one where their last five days flashes in Petra's eyes."
"The first time this had happened it could have been a simple accident. Though Levi is not known for being scatterbrained, Eren understands he sometimes gets absorbed in his work and loses track of time. He had brushed it off and not thought much about the captain's absence. The second time it had happened it could have just been a coincidence. Now -the third time- Eren can no longer ignore the reality of the situation. Levi is avoiding him, and Eren has no idea why."
"‚ÄúI was separated from you... I don‚Äôt want to feel that ever again.‚Äù"
"For two boys in 1968, a chance encounter in gay conversion therapy may act as the catalyst towards a world of self-discovery, acceptance, and possibly, even more."
"""I wish that I could wake up with amnesia, and forget about the stupid little things, like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you, and the memories I never can escape."""
"Time has passed slowly since the incident involving the female Titan. Since Eren's decision. Since Levi had come to hate him. Or at least that's what he'd like to believe, because how can he accept that he's falling in love with the reason his squad is dead."
"Eren was her hero. He would always be her hero. But Mikasa no longer wanted to be a part of this story."

Can Lena's light melt the ice of humanity's strongest soldier?"
"The stars were out now, shining through the wispy skeletons of barren trees, their forms reduced to naught but bones by winter‚Äôs embrace. They looked like vines. Twisting, reaching, grasping; suffocating their neighbours and fighting for the moon‚Äôs attention like leaves did the sun."
"Everyone knows that superpowers are the stuff of stories, nothing more than nonsense to give kids something to be excited about... right? Ever since manifesting otherworldly abilities when he was just a child, Jean Kirstein has been hidden deep in the bowels of SURVEY headquarters, a group designed to 'train' people like him for 'their own safety'- yeah, bullshit. He was perfectly content being the resident asshole of his team of superpowered freaks, but after he‚Äôs tasked with helping kidnap a newly manifested Deviant from his family home, Jean realizes that he may have to protect more than just himself. Marco, the prior mentioned Deviant, struggles to acclimate to his new life, especially when a certain doctor who may or may not have a screw loose takes a special interest in him."

"The familiar tones of green and amber have been taunting him from afar ever since he‚Äôs learned how to stand on his own two feet again. It‚Äôs just a simple hickory tree. It‚Äôs only a few metres ahead of him, but Levi hasn‚Äôt been able to reach it."
"The first time you lay eyes upon Armin, you can‚Äôt help but pity him."
"Jean can't take life and it's hardships anymore; its too much to handle for him. He feels like he is about to explode, like a time-bomb that constantly ticks away. But Marco helps him rise from his ashes, in a rather different way. Jeanmarco week, Day 5: Ash."

"Ymir and Historia share one last moment before Ymir leaves to help Reiner and Bertholdt. ‚Äî A very short, quick fanfiction that is set in the same episode where Ymir says goodbye to Historia, except I decided to change it around a little bit. They deserved a few more moments together, and this is simply that."
"From sitting on bridges to meeting in coffee shops. From friendship trouble to Calculus tutoring. From carnival dates to Christmas parties. From birthday picnics to cemeteries. From guilty confessions to meeting childhood friends. From beer pong games to quoting Lady Gaga. From cute berets to food fights. From innocent dinner parties to exposing games of Never Have I Ever. From dancing in the rain to first times. Eren and Levi had gone through it all. But Levi didn‚Äôt know if he would be able to get through this."
"Levi beat the shit out of Eren in that court room. Everyone saw that episode. But what if someone changed the course of things from that very moment? Well, I did that and that's how this fic was born. Eren and Levi on their way to kill titans and make love. From complete strangers to friends and maybe even something more."
"Singing in each other's ear. Silly conversations. Heartfelt smiles. Everything finally falling into place. Their much awaited post wedding dance is about to happen."
"After another failed expedition, Levi can no longer remain silent about his true intentions for Erwin. Sometimes I slide away Silently I slowly lose myself Over and over Take comfort in my skin Endlessly Surrender to my will Forever and ever Heaven - Depeche Mode"
"""I love you,"" Levi mumbled into his hair, placing a lingering kiss there. ""That's not going to fix me, Levi."""
"'YOUR FAULT. And it was true as well,' Levi thought, 'he should have been watching, making sure they were okay, but now they were fighting for their lives.¬†His¬†squad. He was the Captain, not some stupid new rookie.'"
"Erwin can still remember the sound of his father‚Äôs voice, soft and gentle but vibrant as he detailed the expanse of the world outside the walls. Erwin thinks of how, with his own foolishness, he silenced it."
"There was a legend about the well in the garden. They said it would grant wishes, but not for free. They said it would ask for your soul, in return for every wish it granted."
"Armin, Eren, and three dead bodies. When Armin kills a person for the first time, Eren is not there."

A nearly fatally wounded Mikasa is tended to by a guilt-ridden Eren. The task leads to a conversation and chain of events that throws the nature of their relationship into question. [Eremika.

"I wrote this story a long time ago and honestly I just remember my intention of this story was to try and get the feeling of near obsession when it comes to someone you idolize and I remember when I first watched Attack on Titan The relationship between Eren and Levi was idolisation of an authority figure and a stupid kid who just wanted to be regonised as not a monster and trusted. So yeah that's the feeling I wanted to come across and I'm not going to re-read this as the writer it just...yikes the cringe."
"Erwin doesn‚Äôt move, doesn‚Äôt blink, just stands there staring down at Levi.  Levi stares back, holding his gaze.  He could kill him here, now, it would be so easy.  He‚Äôs armed, Erwin‚Äôs injured, and there‚Äôs no one else about. But Erwin‚Äôs death would no longer serve any purpose.  So much has changed in these last twelve hours. Lifetimes have passed; Farlan‚Äôs, Isabel‚Äôs, what ever his own life was before.  The only connection to them he has left is the bloody badge crumpled in his pocket, this uniform and, somehow, this man standing in front of him.

"Their lives were a crazy mess but one thing was certain. That every Friday at midnight they would meet in their spot. Somewhere only they know. Their safe haven."
"Eren is a kindergarten teacher that feels like he'll never be good enough for anything while Levi, on the other hand, is a Demon disguised as a business man and grows bored of all of his play things but along comes this bright-eyed brat that captures his attention. What happens when Levi gets summoned by Eren, unbeknownst to the kid, and can't seem to leave him alone? Or where Eren is a teacher with panic attacks and Levi is a demon/business man that is trying to escape something that won't quite go away.

"It's hard enough leaving the love of your life behind, but it's even harder coming face to face with him again under less than desirable circumstances years later. Young and Vulnerable follows the story of Jean Kirschtien, who has been desperately in love with Eren Jaeger since college, and his struggle to come out of the closet. Or that story in which Eren and Jean meet again and Jean keeps trying to get in Eren's pants, but Eren is dating Levi and Jean just got married to Mikasa."
"Bedding the Commander will not be easy... How will a thug from the royal capital be able to walk forward alongside Humanity's Strongest, especially when the thug is a woman in disguise and in love with the Commander?"
"Power - That was what he needed to survive. Not just because Kenny told him so; because Levi experienced it everyday. Yet there's more to life than just power. The events that led Kenny to think an 11 year old Levi was strong enough to be on his own in the Underground. (It may be part 13 of a series, but every fic is independent.)

"‚ÄúWhy the fuck are you out here, Mike?‚Äù ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt old comrades see each other?‚Äù"
"What‚Äôs the point in measuring how many years you‚Äôve lived when any day you might die? He tells himself this and he tells himself that he doesn‚Äôt care, the way he tells himself he doesn‚Äôt care about a lot of things, and he tells himself he doesn‚Äôt know today was Erwin‚Äôs birthday even though he does."
"Kenny and his squad survived the roast chicken titan's transformation, kidnapped Armin and Hanji while Levi's squad was busy dealing with the titan, and are planning to have some 'fun' with them..."
"‚Äúthe world could burn in her wake, and you would still tread through the ashes to follow her.‚Äù"
"You had always been different and led a rather lonely existence, rarely letting anyone get too close to you. Memories of lost companions had hung vivid in your mind and your past had made you the person you were today - strong, determined and focussed. Using that strength, you decided to answer the call of enlistment, pushing all of your skills towards a goal. A purpose. Choosing the path of the survey corps was obvious as you had an unrivalled strength in your trainee squad and wanted to put it to good use for once. You had not expected what awaited you when you entered the imposing grounds of the survey corps HQ, the man you were reunited with and were wholly unprepared for the journey that followed."
"How do you even summarize a poem? It's just a sad little poem about Eren and Levi's love in canon-verse...."
"Jean and Armin have a deal to meet from time to time and be together in order to relieve the stress of their intense lives. However, Jean realizes his feelings for Armin might be real, but not reciprocrate. So he ends up letting his insecurity and jealousy take over.

"When Levi gets injured during an expedition Eren retreats with him into an abandoned cabin. [Ereri NSFW Weekend Bash 2016 | Day 1: Foreplay]"
"el-e-gy el…ôjƒì a poem of serious reflection, typically a lament for the dead ------ A sonorous laugh escapes my mouth. ""Alright kid,"" I say, bringing his lips down to mine. After a moment, I pull away and gaze up at him. Light from the dying sun bouncing off his brown hair and framing his face, the contrasting shadows making his usually soft face a touch sharper, giving it a more aged appearance. His green eyes holding a certain air to them that's entirely too hard describe but I can't help but feel the overwhelming sense of home and security that's found within them. ""Would you ever die for me, Levi?"" I stare up at him for the longest time; this kid who has managed to effortlessly break down every last barrier I put up. Who I would give up most anything for. And I don't hesitate before saying: ""Over and over."" ------ I do not own any of the characters presented in this series. All rights to anything related to ""Attack on Titan"" belong to Isayama and Isayama alone."
"In a world without titans, Levi babysits Eren, taking care of him in place of Eren's parents just like Levi did in their past lives. But then Levi leaves for college. History has a way of repeating itself, even in reincarnated lives, but this time Levi isn‚Äôt around when Eren needs his guidance most. *That summary is vague af because it was for this fic when it was a one-shot. The new summary would mention that Eren is a badass gang member and Levi misses the sweet boy he once knew."
"Levi is obsessively in love with Eren."
"When soulmates meet, they each grow a pair of matching wings. Eren doesn't really give soulmates much thought until the day he gets his wings. To Erwin, having a soulmate is burden that he does not want to bear."
"Hindsight is 20/20"
"Society is segregated by Zodiac signs. The date birth of an individual separates them from one another. Tattoos of each sign's symbol determines visual confirmation of who is safe to talk to. It is a system that has been enriched in the people by the government since the Constitution was first instituted, and has carried on into modern day. Armin wants to change this. And he'll be damned if he's going to do it alone."
"There are some worthy of the divine punishment sought for them, even if their guilt is never as apparent as their innocence."
"Snippets of how Captain Levi and Squad Leader Hanji bonded over the years and eventually fall in love. Too bad they are clueless about it."
"Marco looks at Jean‚Äïhis face flushed and still, beautifully, breathless‚Äïand thinks Jean is far more like a sprout than a shotgun shell. He thinks maybe he might be too. He thinks maybe none of them were ever bullets in the beginning."
"Eren befriends Levi when they're both little kids.  But fate has some screwing around to do.  They lose touch and each longs to see the other again. A/N:  There are memories, time skips, dreams, and flashbacks in this fic that aren't always labeled."
"The job you did was demanding, but you were damn good at it. Always three steps ahead, you were the go-to person in the office. But you didn't let it get to your head and you remained a quiet yet friendly member of the team. After working hours, you often retreated to your second home, leading something of a double life. Your helpful and open demeanour to colleagues and friends hid your darker thoughts inside and you dealt with the daily struggle of trying to keep it all together and be the best you could be. It didn't help that one of the directors of your department was a distraction and you often found your mind drifting to thoughts of him, his dark ebony hair and pale features. Not that he ever looked twice at you. But then, out of nowhere, he did."
"Levi fucked it all up. Where was Eren now? Did he want to know? Based off ""Your Bed"" by All Time Low (with much imagination involved)."
"For his whole life, Levi has found it difficult to socialize and sabotages himself whenever it comes to his happiness. Due to mental illness and some other ""quirks"" as some people call them, he works to make his life perfect, but he's never reached that standard, needing to stop his habit of isolating himself. But being eccentric to others and being wary of everyone doesn't exactly help. And everything changes when some stranger just has to be his friend for some reason he can't figure out. (Warning: some characters are very ooc)"
"A cleaning accident leads to injury, hurt feelings, and a partial breakup of Erurihan."
"But man? Man is stretching so far. The fact is, Marco was only 16. A brief summary of his dying thoughts and reflections. Trying to sound all fancy here but I'm really just writing out some depressing feelings about this poor kid. Based on the weird shot that's only in the anime from Marco's p.o.v. when Jean finds him, leading the viewers to believe he hadn't quite died. So yeah. Free invite to cry with me."
"Zacklay finally made his move. He would strike back against Erwin after the Corps' ""failed"" expedition into Shiangashina. He was about to rip everything from Eren. Eren had a home now, a family, in the arms of two men he'd never imagined he would come to love. But now he can't imagine life without them. The order has been issued: Erwin will take the titan serum. If he loses himself, it will be on Humanity's Strongest to kill him. But then Levi would take his own life, and Eren would be alone again. If all goes well, the Survey Corps will be more powerful than ever. And there's some interesting new research that they recovered from Grisha Yeager's basement lab. Research that could change the fate of Humanity. Since when have summaries ever been my thing? Basically shit happens Survey Corps style in Shiangashina, and all they bring home are some books and some titan serum. Zacklay orders Erwin be the first to try it. Then threesome smut. Then some angst. Then some fluff. This is the intro to a multipart series I'm working on that is (VERY) vaguely crossed over with Full Metal Alchemist. No FMA characters will appear. I'm just stealing alchemy."
"Eren is a big fan of the band ""No Name"",but one day when he thought it was his luckiest day of his life to meet the band No Name. it turns out when he finally meets the lead singer,everything he thought and respected about them was a lie. He learns they were all ghouls from the start. Shingeki No Kyojin and Tokyo ghoul Crossover (Yey another brief crap summary)"
"""They didn‚Äôt know him. And that was okay. Because if they didn‚Äôt remember him, that meant they didn‚Äôt remember the horrors of their past lives, either. They didn‚Äôt remember the horror of watching their friends fall around them one by one, or the terror of watching the titans breach the walls. And that alone made him happy."" In a world where Titans are a thing of the distant past, few remember the horrors of the war fought to free humanity from their walled confines. Eren J√§ger, reborn and rechristened, spent twenty-one years praying Levi Ackerman wouldn't remember, and hoping that he would."
"Finally decided to post my first ever work from way back to this site (._.) Well sit back and enjoy the ride. Disclaimer: I own nothing from this fandom except my idea for this fiction."
"After all this time, they're just the same as they were when they could count their ages on their fingers. ""You know you were always mine right?"" ""From the moment I saw your face."" ~ Mikasa watches her two boys grow up in love."
"(Part 2 following 'they're just two poor kids') ~ Armin loves him and literally drowns in his eyes until it's the last thing he sees."
"Eren gets bitten by a zombie due to some unwise choices. He doesn't want Jean to find out, but ultimately, Jean figures out that something's obviously wrong with his boyfriend. They share their last moments together."
"Eren giggled, nose scrunching up and face reddening and looking so ridiculously adorable that Levi couldn‚Äôt do anything other than swoop in and kiss him right on those grinning lips. It was chaste, nothing but a brush of their mouths, but it soothed an ache Levi had been feeling for weeks now. As good as it felt, though, he knew it was a mistake as soon as he pulled back enough to find that obsidian gaze shimmering in pain."
"A one-shot in which an impatient Levi waits for a very late Eren. In which Erwin stalks him, for justifiable but underappreciated reasons. In which Hange anticipates for drama to unfold with a heavy heart. In which people wait, but for different reasons."
"Whilst Eren Yeager didn't have the most conventional of jobs, being a personal escort certainly had its perks. To him there was nothing better than being showered in compliments, taken to fancy restaurants, frequent sex, and even better, being paid for it. Whilst his life wasn't perfect, he had everything he could ever want. So why was he so enamored by the short, grumpy librarian?"
"‚ÄúYou really let this place fall to shit when you‚Äôre alone.‚Äù Somehow life goes on, cruel and unfair as ever. Somehow, it‚Äôs been three days and the door to his office is left wide open though Erwin knows he had locked it. Shutting out the world is one thing, something he learned and honed long before accepting the title of Commander. Shutting out Levi is another thing entirely, almost impossible and decidedly not worth the astounding amount of effort it would take to try."
"Levi Ackerman fell in love with a certain turquoise-eyed brunet since the first time he laid his eyes. For a year, he's just loving him from afar. But one day, this brunet asked him if he could court his sister. What will happen to his unspoken feelings? "" It's funny how the ones who can make you happy are the ones who can also break you. It's fucking ironic, really."""
"One of them has bite marks on his hand because his inner monster made him do it. One of them has a mouth dirtier than anything he owns yet he only speaks 500 words a day. One of them has never seen the ocean but has cried enough tears to fill one. One of them has to maintain a straight face but once it's dark her anxiety takes her breath away. One of them has memorised the bottom of all the bottles he drank to forget about his friend. One of them has to struggle day by day to keep the food that she eats down. One of them has to make up her own world because she doesn't dare to face reality. All of them long to see the world behind their walls."
"‚ÄúEren should be here.‚Äù Those were the first words spoken by anyone in the group who had discovered the Ocean again. (Or, they reach the Ocean and Eren isn't there to see it.)"
"About to return from practicing fighting, Shikishima is surprised and delighted to find the person he holds dear to him waiting for him. He reflects on who he is though, and if she'll still love him when she finds out."
"""He can't help but think back and remember Marco's terrified eyes when his ears pick up those quiet sobs in the darkness."" Bertholdt notices Jean's downfall after Marco's death."

"Virgin America, America's best Airline recruites only the finest employees, including top ranked pilot Captain Levi and co-pilot Erwin Smith. Eren Yeagar just graduated college and turns to Portland International Airport looking for a job as a flight attendant."
"Eren anticipates Levi's death (Not a manga spoiler, just for this fic), just as in their previous life. Shocked to see him come home. Terribly summary! Hope it's okay."
"He's made the decision to take the next step in recovery, but that won't be the end of the journey. Harboring haunting memories and mental illnesses, the struggles in life aren't over. But with the stubborn, bright-eyed one who's proved to be more persistent than the monster itself, Levi becomes stronger than ever, even if at times his weakness comes forth to test that strength."
"It‚Äôs with a start that Erwin realizes, now and only now, after all this time and all that hurt, that the Levi of his dreams, his memories, the boy from the Underground with that fierceness, that fight, that desire to live, to burn, his captain who would follow him into Hell with unwavering trust, with love, left him long ago, has been gone perhaps for centuries. He knows now, without a doubt, that this is his punishment, this sadness that constricts and binds and consumes, this exhaustion that he has breathed into the only person who has ever given Erwin‚Äôs cursed existance any meaning. One thousand years or more of suffering, and it is his doing and his alone. He has taken everything Levi has ever had, whether the man was willing to give it or not, and has left him empty."

"Rena Meyer has been part of Squad Leader Arlert's team for a few months now. The man seems cold and calculating, ready and able to sacrifice lifes as needed without being affected by it. After a particularly gruesome mission she is left with nightmares and wanders the halls, until she comes across and unlocked door. There she overhears a conversation not ment for her ears, but maybe it's just what she needed to hear. Spoilers for chapter 84."
"Elma Kneller was normal just like everyone else until she was not. She had someone she needed to protect and she had to do whatever it took to keep them safe. Only that the person she felt and knew she had to protect was humanities strongest, Captain Levi of the Survey Corps. How is she supposed to protect the strongest person alive without giving her secret away when she knew next to nothing about it herself? All she knew was that she would and figure out who or what she was no matter the cost. NOTE: Special abilities OC world-building story in AOT world. Read tags."

"And then she realised. Maybe this was what he meant about them being similar. Maybe he wasn't telling her any of this, as such. Maybe he was looking into a mirror, speaking only what he felt in his own heart, as much to himself as anyone else."
"Erwin is gone and so is Levi's will to move on. With the help/supervision of others, he survives, but not thrives, to see the day of humanity's freedom. With everyone busy, he decides it's time he finally made someone very dear to him an important visit."

"The one where Mikasa visits Annie, and reminisces about their time together."
"The date is June 17, 2017. Eren Jaeger is just a normal high school student with no life. In fact, it had become kind of boring. Eren didn't do much other than go to school and play video games with his best friend Armin. Little does he know that his whole world is going to change right in front of his eyes. A couple days after summer starts,  Eren sees an unusual shaped object fall from the sky. When he goes to investigate, he finds it to be a strange metallic sphere.

Will he give him to the authorities that continue to come to his door? Or Will he protect the strange creature from the humans who wish him harm?

"After having turned into a Titan for the first time, Armin encounters Jean again."
"Flowing through life like a warm summer breeze was as good as it could be expected. No real worries, no deep-rooted troubles, no regrets‚Äîbut that also meant having no ambitions whatsoever. When 18-year-old Eren Jeager leaves his hometown to go to college, he never expected to realise how much of a wasteful, feverish fool he'd been all his life. But above all, he never expected to fall in love. Surprisingly, all it took was a very shitty new college life, some tattered books, and a few crumbling autumn leaves."

"After a disastrous expedition, Hanji is deeply upset and Levi wants to help her."
"When Armin and Erwin discover that the old world had a holiday called Christmas, which just happens to fall on Levi's birthday, Erwin decrees a celebration for the Survey Corps. Secret gifts, Christmas tree disasters, and other shenanigans ensue... and keeping the celebration secret might be harder than they thought. Canon divergent wherein certain people are actually alive. Slightly crack. Lots of fluff. Each ship gets their own chapter."
"Everyone has a red thread tied to their ring finger. They're fickle things, growing thicker, getting thinner. They reflect the status of your current relationship or connect you to your next one. After Eren snaps his first string he believes he'll never find love again, until another string appears, tied to a small, angry raven, who came with the most beautiful set of grey eyes."

"Rivaille had always been alone."
"Eren walks in on Rivaille reflecting on that day‚Ä¶"
"Breathing was easy. No matter what, he had to keep going. Forgetting about Marco was slightly harder. The images of his friend as a corpse still haunted him. Opening up to someone about it was extremely difficult. However, there had been something about Armin that night that allowed him to do so. And confronting himself about the blossoming emotions he felt for his newfound acquaintance might just kill him. ""In a world where everyone's dying, can you live for me?"" Or, a story that gives an extremely long reason for why Armin Arlet gets a haircut."
"--- Were you in a deep sleep? Do you think you are still dreaming? --- Levi can feel when his heart stops beating, when there's more of his blood on the ground around him than there is pumping through his veins. He knew he'd rush headlong into death after Erwin, but he hopes his sacrifice bought those damn brats enough time to end it. Finally. There is a moment where he must be dead; a contented, restful moment, before he is gasping into life again, hands twisting against a wound that is no longer there."
"Written for a prompt on the kink meme. Eren is gravely injured while on a mission; Jean is terrified that he's going to lose another important comrade (just like Marco)."
"At first, Levi thought they were just strange dreams, but he came to realise how wrong he was. With his memories of a past life and past lover still fresh in his mind; Levi lives his life wishing he didn't have them or wishing he wasn't alone. So how will he start to feel when his lover returns but has no memory of him? Levi must do everything ihe can to make Eren remember - he doesn't want to be alone anymore."
"Marco Bodt, a young man seeking to spend a new life in America, boards the RMS Titanic. Little does he know, the next few days he spends on the vessel will impact his life beyond his wildest dreams."
"Even during the worst of times, Jean could rely on Marco to brighten his day. An obvious songfic with plenty of fluff, sex, and angst."

But that all changed when a mysterious man with gleaming green-blue eyes and an arm picked him off the slums and taught him everything that made him now. ...Until one day...he wasn't there anymore...

Problem is, he doesn't know what to do with this kid."
"Hanji doesn't tend to listen to Levi's advice often, usually ending in her running off somewhere. But even with Levi around she is not always certain to return in one piece."
"There are some things that you just don't talk about. Some things that aren't meant to be listened to, are not meant to be seen, are not meant to be understood. That's why they fit together so perfectly, like puzzle pieces. They were not meant to be seen or heard or understood. They were not meant to be talked about. Eren and his impossible ability to bend and break things with just his mind alone. Levi and his ability to bend and break just Eren with his words. We're going to talk about them anyways."
"Marco is still trying to get back into the swing of things a year after an accident that cost him his eyesight and his right arm. Things start to look up once he meets guide dog instructor, Jean, and his new partner, Acacia. The accident changed him, but does that keep him from exploring a new relationship?"
"Eren doesn't ever want to see what fear does to people."
"He's a monster. They tell him night after night as they take their fill. When a mission goes wrong and he finds himself stranded and in heat, with alpha Levi! I promise, it's at least a little bit good... maybe... *1-10 have been fixed* *Chapters 29-40, have been fixed up my loves xx*"

"Is a life without you worth living? Following Marco's death, Jean seems to be coping well. However, it's hard to move on, especially when he has regrets. His biggest one? Not telling Marco how he feels. Unfortunately, it's impossible to fix now. Or is it?"
"Jean lays in bed the night after the cleanup of Trost and the discovery of Marco's death."
"To tame a beast that was once human, one must act like one, think like one, and feel like one. Still, Levi knew he didn‚Äôt need to do that. He could shape the boy back into a human without having to degrade himself, or so he thought. What if the human that had been living in the wild for more than ten years had something else in sight? ~An Ereri fanfic~"
"You‚Äôre nine lives walking on two wires, and you‚Äôve cheated more things than death. So you cannot die. That was a conclusion and then it was an order."
"Bertholdt's thoughts about Reiner's problem, their mission, and his duty of fullfilling it and what it has already cost them and will further on. Bertl's POV; can be read as Gen or implied M/M"

"Eren and Levi are sex friends...or maybe something more?"
"Armin deals with the aftermath of witnessing the terrible things that happen during their expeditions and Eren just wants to comfort him."
"Marco, with his sweet smile and idealistic nature, always putting Jean before him. Marco, who blushed at every raunchy joke he made, whose cheeks flushed a scarlet red when Jean kissed every freckle on his face, deserved better than a couple of wood planks haphazardly nailed together."
"It had something to do with the rain. Twice Ymir had lost something important. Although if she were lucky and in a haze, she'd keep her promise. But like most things to Ymir, nothing was ever simple or easy or kind."
"Where Reiner and Bertholdt are true warriors in disguise; with a dash of Eren‚Äôs fetish and Levi‚Äôs odd trait."
"You're terrified. The fear lives in between your organs, in your chest, in your throat, in your stomach, cold and clammy. It spreads to numb your limbs, making you clumsy. You're laughed at. It's all in good nature of course, they couldn't possibly know its anything but you adjusting to your height, but when Reiner laughs too it stops being a little thing and starts to seem more like a parasite. You feel sick."
"He stands alone at a grave at dawn."
"Eren Yeager is in love with his supervisor, Levi. One night, he accidentally tells him how he feels. Levi, however feels grossed out and leaves. Then Eren makes it his ultimate goal to get Levi to fall for him."
"He knows his heart is best kept stashed away, but instead, he keeps taking it out, again and again, because he can't help it, and now it's tarnished. He'd be a lot better off, and more efficient besides, if he didn't care, but Levi has always been bad at not caring."
"He never thought it would come to this, but really, he should have seen it coming. Standing over her rotting form, he realizes now that it was inevitable."
"It all started with a bouquet and a job offer. The two unlikeliest of things, soon intertwined into one. All it took was one decision; thought by two minds. ~~~~~~ Eren Jaeger is twenty three years old, and is a current student at  Kyojin University, where Titans rise! Levi Ackerman is a famous photographer that resides in Los Angeles, and has been offered a job to photograph the beauty of the small town, Trost. If by not fate, then coincidentally these two paths cross, what will be in store for the two?"

"Two years after the attack on Trost, Jean finds himself starting to see others for the first time since Marco's death. But the fear and guilt surrounding Marco's death has never left him, now projecting onto those around him. Perhaps tranquility is closer than he ever thought possible, something he can find in life and not by following his love into the afterlife."

Squinting, you make out the form of your friend Marco in the bunk to your left, one half of his freckled face shrouded in darkness and the other lit up with a gentle glow of silver. Despite his baby face, broad forehead and dumb-ass haircut, you think he looks quite pretty in the moonlight. He looks peaceful. You stumble out of bed and shake him vigorously by the shoulder. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs freezing,‚Äù you state.

"The capture of the Armored Titan should have been one of the greatest victories in the history of the Scouting Legion... They'd found it hard to celebrate a victory, after chaining a half-dead child to a wall. This work is a sequel to RIP, part 1 of the Cumulative Injury Cycle series"
"No. He only barely had teeth. The ruin of his mouth, the exit wound just barely missed the critical point. Half his head must have been blown away."

"One night Eren was walking to his apartment and suddenly he stumble on something or someone... He meets this mysterious man and Eren life will change but will it be for better or worts?"
"Life went by, but things weren't simple by any means. Levi was still yet to experience Alphas visiting the House and choosing Omegas of their liking for purposes he couldn't even force himself to think about. His body shuddered involuntarily. What would happen if someone picked him? Pestering thoughts plagued his mind as warm water from the shower hit his face and chest. There were other Omegas around him, scrubbing their bodies and exchanging hasty whispers, but Levi kept his eyes closed, detaching himself just as he always did. Lost in his own nightmares, he listened to the droplets of water hitting skin.

"Marco had barely managed to talk himself out of that titan's mouth. Regardless, it left him nearly half blind, struggling to adjust to life without his arm, and perhaps most pressing, a prisoner of war in Marley. The few months his spends in the war prison in Liberio prove to be as educational as they are terrifying- the world is so much bigger than he'd imagined, filled with other people, ideas, with magic. When he finally managed to escape that, he had no clue where he was going or how he was going to get home. That is, until he finds himself people willing to help. Primarily Marco's perspective. No knowledge of anything beyond AOT is necessary to understand things, as magic, other characters and plots are being introduced as he learns. Extremely long play JeanMarco (After being asked plenty of times on TikTok, I'm posting this! It's heavily based off of the RP I have done over discord with a friend. This world setting has major players in the AOT world such as Marley and Paradis, but other countries from other fandoms have been implimented.)"

Standing at a tall table at the outer edge of the dance floor was a tall blonde talking to a couple at the table.  Levi watched as he turned and scanned the crowd almost self-consciously.

At the local tavern, Jean sees a childhood friend, and they catch up for the first time in years. He was a soldier now, and you... Well, he can hardly recognize you."
"When Levi, Isabel, and Furlan join the Survey Corps, you're one of the captains in charge of keeping an eye on them and overseeing their training. They remind you of the past, and it's difficult for your heart to stay away from them, even when your mind is saying that they probably won't survive, so keep them at an arm's length. They're just like everyone else."
"Levi recollects some personal moments involving Erwin."
"Jean is a freshman at school. Marco is as well. They are about as different as water and mud. Jean is an eccentric guitar player, and Marco is into the sciences. Marco is also a mute and has been for years. When an accident lands Jean in the hospital, Marco finds himself visiting everyday and hoping for him to get better. He decides to teach himself how to speak again to surprise Jean when he wakes up. He practices everyday perfecting it so that he can make the blond boy smile."

"During Eren Yeager's trip to Wal-Mart, the one and only zombie apocalypse started up. So now, he is stuck with many other people in the store. They try to survive, fight, and get along with the strangers they are trapped with, but one person Eren just can't get along with... and that is the one and only, Levi. But will this be a cliched love story? Or will it end with death and turning into a walking dead corpse that smells awful? --I suck at summaries. I tried lol.--"
"Your life has been less than ideal from the very moment you were born, in the dark alley of a slum you wouldn't recognize now no matter how hard you try. The number of times you've been passed around from makeshift parent to makeshift parent is higher than the number of friends you've ever had. So when your best and only friend betrays you for his own benefit, you wonder if you even have the will to keep fighting for the life you've barely lived. But the sun is brighter than you ever could have imagined, and fresh air is so cool and crisp. The pain of deception hurts, but you're determined to find your only parent who has a chance at still being alive, and experience what freedom really feels like."
"‚ÄúI was just thinking about you, and wondered what would happen if I called‚Ä¶‚Äù. Then a very unattractive, uncharacteristic belch. ‚ÄúYou must have had a lot to drink.  I doubt that you have thought of me much at all this past few months.‚Äù  Erwin‚Äôs mouth audibly snapped shut before he could say anything more.  He was supposed to be over this. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wrong,‚Äù Levi said softly after a long pause, and that wasn‚Äôt fair.  Levi had no right to sound like that, like he was as vulnerable and broken as Erwin. ‚ÄúMy phone hasn‚Äôt exactly been ringing off the hook, so forgive me if I have my doubts.‚Äù ‚ÄúI understand why you feel that way, but you‚Äôre all I think about-‚Äú ‚ÄúLevi, don‚Äôt,‚Äù Erwin interrupted, hurt burning in the back of his throat.  ‚ÄúYou wanted things to be this way.   You didn‚Äôt want me anymore.  You don‚Äôt get to do this. You don‚Äôt get to act like you‚Äôre hurt.‚Äù"
"""Do you want to go on an adventure?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said as he stared into the quiet mystery of Armin‚Äôs eyes and almost forgot the second part of his sentence, which came tumbling out of his mouth like a hasty assurance, ‚ÄúI do.‚Äù"
"Marco has always believed in soulmates. Or...at least he did until several bad breakups. Jean used to believe in soulmates until his parents split. When the both of them end up at the same school, in the same major, sparks fly. Did they find their soulmates? Or is Marco just waiting to get his heart broken again."

"Eren and his brother are fighting Reiner and his friends in Shiganshina, where everything started, but what about the humans ? These poor souls without any powers, fighting anyways for their liberty and country ? Jean is only a man, and  he would have fought until the end if there was really a reason for all this slaughter. Now, he's just tired of theses deaths and bullshits. Mikasa can't get over Eren's word and it's getting her crazy. What's the point of living if her reason of living hate her and is now the enemy who want to kill them ?

""Eren My El Ninyo Brother what the fuck are you doing."" Mikusa said. ""This is a political statement Mikasa!"" Eren bite off his own dick and howled in pain. ""Ok."" Said Mikasa"
"Armin had lost all trace of roundness in his face. He slept, curled inside the crystal like a starved sprite, yellow hair suspended like gossamer in ice. Levi knelt beside the crystal, running his hands softly over it's surface. Armin was, to his eye, the most beautiful thing he would ever see, or ever know. His sun was setting, and he was only twenty-eight years old."
"Year 2850. Levi's always had dreams about his previous life, ever since he can remember. One day, he bumps into a familiar boy with different coloured eyes. Those wild eyes that once shone with pure fire, now beaten into submission. But no matter how different they looked now, he had no doubt they belonged to Eren J√§ger. Levi will soon find Eren isn‚Äôt as happy in this life as he had hoped he would be, so he vows to himself to do everything in his power to give him the peaceful, happy life he deserves. Along this journey, he will find more people with memories of their past lives. However, not all of them are friends."
"Even if it wasn‚Äôt that odd place between night and morning, I wouldn‚Äôt see the sun. I had drawn the blinds shut, and there was no chance that light could brighten this room. In some ways it reflected how I felt."
"Eren was away for a little while, and he and Jean missed each other. Sad, gay, and steamy."
"A bunch of one shots, in which you help Levi and otherwise. You go through a lot of bad things, but also good things. You comfort Levi and he does the same in his own way. But in some you also fight against him and with him, whether it is against titans or humans. Enjoy"
"They were naive to think their secret was well kept; it always felt like they were in their own little world. But when something threatens that happiness, they'll have to fight for what they have."

"Sasha likes to keep up a charade of happiness but she isn't happy. Not in the inside. But then again who cares how Potato girl feels? This is where I shall be putting my sad Sasha fcis and maybe one funny one."
"Levi was never one for sweets in general, but found that he absolutely craved ice cream after a bout of deeply satisfying sex.  This craving had not reared its head until he started sleeping with Erwin, but Levi refused to think about what that implied.  The flavor of ice cream varied based on the intensity and duration of the prior sexual activity."
"Canonverse. In which levi finds you satisfying yourself after he couldn‚Äôt satisfy you for months, feels like shit about it and tries to make it up to you with some fluffy sex."
"The road to love is paved with masturbation."
"One hundred years. One hundred and three‚Ä¶ One hundred and twenty-four‚Ä¶ Was the number of years he spent waiting for him‚Ä¶ Still... he found no sign of his raven-haired lover.

"To go beyond, to spread her wings and discover a world she only read about in books; in a single day that dream was thwarted forcing her to be content with living in a bird cage."
"According to canon, a reluctant Jean and Armin must pretend to be Eren and Krista and offer themselves up for capture in their place. But what if Levi and Mikasa hadn't shown up in time? ...This might not turn out how you imagine..."
"Ymir and Historia used to have a thing, a complicated thing, but now they won't even talk to each other. There is alcohol, drinking games, what could go wrong ?"
"Levi stared at the slender finger resting on his chest, sweat starting to accumulate on his skin from a bizarre combination of horror and exhilaration. He could feel eyes on him, the envious stares doing nothing to alleviate the hell-storm of emotions clawing at his insides. Beneath his alpha‚Äôs howls of elation, dread begun to creep through his veins. ‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶‚Äù Teal eyes flittered over him critically, a devious smirk pinching at his cheeks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to keep him.‚Äù"

"It was the way he walked that got her: the power in his stride, the confidence with which he moved, never arrogant. Each night she became more and more restless, and each night he looked more and more attractive. Something had been building‚Äîa pressure slowly rising and liable to burst. And perhaps it had been growing for a while now, well before she'd arrived at his doorstep with a storm at her back. Mikasa was at the end of her rope. And the war had ended a while ago."
"Exhausted, Armin, Mikasa and Eren have a chance to relish in gratitude because they survived the attack on the Trost district."
"It was then, in a little tea shop just off the main street, Eren saw him once again. Face like that of a ghost from the past, dug up from within the deepest confines of Eren's dust filled chest. A man who he'd never expected to see, with his dark eyes and furrowed brow. He looks just the same, but so different. He looks alive... Not like back then, all those years ago. When Eren was freshly parentless and trying to find himself. And Levi, then freshly alone and trying to cope from day to day."
"Corporal Levi and Mikasa Ackerman were sent to rescue Commander Erwin from the hands of the Military Police Brigade. It looks like they underestimated the MPB and are cornered from the underground. One of them has to get out and distract them. Will they make it back alive?"

"‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move.‚Äù A deep voice, guttural with fury, commanded. A familiar voice, for all he‚Äôd never heard it speak in that tone before. Levi stiffened all over, the shell of bloodlust surrounding him cracking straight down the center at the sound. The woman's liver slithered out of his stunned grip to hit the cobblestones with an obscene splat. Every fiber of his body was jumping with shock. He‚Äôd been caught. He‚Äôd thought‚Äîhe‚Äôd hoped‚Ä¶ But he‚Äôd been caught, at last, just when he‚Äôd thought his cover was more secure than it had ever been. He‚Äôd been caught by that fucking blond bastard Erwin Smith. Levi is one of the last ghouls left, and he's not okay with it, but he's dealing as well as he can. Until Erwin finds out, and hatches the plan of using an inhuman monster to fight Titans years before Eren Yeager shows up. Time to show what the original man-eaters can do. (Knowledge of Tokyo Ghoul not necessary to read, knowledge of Birth of Levi gaiden helpful.)"
"True, or false. Real, or not real. What is reality if not a figment of our imagination?"
"They were nothing more than dreams. Nothing more than further proof of an imaginative mind. That's what Eren tried to convince himself as he laid eyes on the stranger with an all too familiar face. It was the same face that had been haunting his sleep for months now. Could this be some bizarre coincidence? Is it possible to dream of someone before having met them? Or perhaps they had met...long, long ago...in a world much different from our own. *THIS WORK IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND CURRENTLY BEING EDITED/UPDATED*"

"The first time Levi found a bundle of hand-picked white lilies tied to the handle of his blades, he was overcome with rage. In world filled with transactions, some things aren't always a simple give and take."
"After a horrible car crash, Levi was left in the hospital looking for his lover, yet stuck with a family reluctant to give out details."
"**SPOILERS for those who only watch the anime! After the battle of Shigansina, Levi is the one to give the eulogy for the fallen. Historia sees through his facade and comforts him when no one else knows how."
"All they knew is to expect the worse. Some of them thought it'll be nothing; that they'd seen something that night, that it was a regular group of titans they'd encountered. Levi knew better. As they returned to that dreaded forest, blood flashed behind his eyelids and silent titans haunt his memory, and Levi knew that whatever secrets are in that forest, they're not supposed to know. SEQUEL TO BODY WAS MADE. Probably can be read as a stand-alone, though some things might not be explained. Recommend reading Body Was Made first."
"Eren wouldn‚Äôt call their particular group the largest, not by a long shot. There were eleven of them total, not including the newly arrived Marco and Mina. There were far larger groups parading around the 104th Camp. Nor was his group the most famous, skilled, powerful, etc. They were well known, sure, but when you were sharing a revamped Walmart with a hundred or so other people, you tended to become at least partially aware of who your new neighbors were. Despite having a few remarkably fantastic titan killers, they were a remarkably ordinary group of people trying to survive a remarkably terrifying zombie apocalypse. At least, until he was bitten. [DISCONTINUED]"
"Levi is lonely and prideful."
"Prejudice, hatred, war. These three simple factors ended humanity as we know it. Seperated families, destroyed lives, broke people. All due to the governments attempts to purify their nations, to rid themselves of the weak, of the omegas. One of the many side affects of this was the contamination of millions of people, with a virus no one could find a cure fo. These people were lovingly dubbed titans. The bio-engeneering to destroy omega genes was orioginally for parents to pick and chose their children, it was critisized then, so imagine when it was used for mass genicide. Eren Jeager was one of the dwindling population of planet Earth, knowing no life of comfort or pleasure. He was born into suffering and there was no escaping it. He hadn't chosen or wanted this but either way he still got it. Life dealt him the card of not only living in this apocalyptic hell, but also of being the only remaining omega. They were scarce before the enialation, now, even several generations down the line, the chemical still stained the genes of most of humanity, making it a more than a suprise when a baby boy was born, showing clear traits of an omega."
"‚ÄúWhat did it look like?‚Äù ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù Levi looked up from his place next to your sleeping form. ‚ÄúThe titan that tried to snack on my darling granddaughter.‚Äù ‚ÄúUgly as fuck.‚Äù ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt they all?‚Äù Levi recounts memories of the reader and their shared life together while she recovers from a serious injury."

"Eren's mouth falls open for a moment, his words lost somewhere in the space between his chest and his tongue.  His eyes drop to Erwin's lips for only a moment and his stomach twists.  He doesn't know what he's doing.  He doesn't know why. Eren/Erwin (in that order)"
"Levi and Mikasa promised each other that they would marry each other after the war between the titans and humanity. They believed, and when the time came when they were born into the modern world, living a present life, that's when Mikasa realized that life is unfair. Modern AU."

"Time travel. It's something that's been spoken of within the science world; but has never proven to be a possibility. Such a feat is too great for human use. Yes, there is talk of multiple world lines existing at once, and how they all differ from one another, however, no one can prove their existence.

"The rain had started up again. Fat droplets drummed over her hood, drenching the fabric. Her horse‚Äôs reins were wet and cold; though her fingers, numbed from continued exposure to the elements, could hardly feel them. Following the sound of the explosion, they‚Äôd arrived at a clearing. It was a mess of blackened, shattered wood, and the wagon, a skeleton, was little more than a smoking husk. Beyond the wreckage, a titan lay prostrate. Felled, its limp, hulking form was barely visible through the rain. As soldiers shouted, pointing at the creature, one of the horses still tethered to the ruined wagon, writhed. When the beast screamed a broken, panicked wail, her own horse shifted, flanks twitching with unease. Hanji barely noticed. The soldiers' voices, the poor beast‚Äôs screams, even the heavy, even thrum of rain - had silenced as she looked to the river. A body lay at the edge of the dark, white-capped water."
"22 year old Eren Jaeger is a stripper at Club Rose and a damn good one at that. He takes his job seriously and loves the attention it gets him. Not to mention the pay ain't so bad. When his usual client and boss, Dot Pixis, requests him to personally perform for his VIP group of colleagues Eren will meet the workaholic, sexually frustrated Levi who can't help but want to make Eren his by the end of the night. Problem is, with a clingy ex boyfriend always coming around begging for sex and a particularly handsome bouncer constantly asking for dates, throw in some commitment issues, past drug addictions and a shit past always coming to bite him in the ass, Eren might not be so easy to win over. Can Levi somehow convince this broken boy that he could be the one to fix him?"
"In every life, everybody found each other In every universe, everybody found each other No matter what, they were all brought together, whether they remembered the life they lived in fear of titans or not. Everybody was there. Except for one, green eyed brat."

"Eren had always been a determined young man, but he could feel his resolve being shaken. His throat went dry and he felt himself getting to the end of his rope. He wanted to take Jean into his arms and kiss him like the world was ending. He wanted to visit Sasha‚Äôs grave. To apologize to everyone. To run away with Jean and never look back at the chaos he had helped create. In four years, he wanted to die in peace, in the arms of the man he loved. But he couldn‚Äôt have that now."
"He snaps open the cylinder again and fishes a small, lead bullet from his pocket. ""One bullet?"" Annie ventures. ""One bullet,"" Armin confirms, dropping the tiny oblong ball of metal into the first chamber. ""In a perfect game,"" he begins slowly, ""there would be eight shots. Four for me and four for you."" The young man hesitates for a moment before continuing. ""Although, I have a feeling we may not get to all eight. We'll go in turns,"" he says, pressing the gun into Annie's hands.

"Since the beginning, she was there with and for him and had grown to mean something special to Erwin. And of course he didn‚Äôt realize it until it was too late."
"Levi found Eren on the streets, lost, alone and beaten. He never wanted to, or even planned to keep the damn boy, but he somehow managed to worm his way into his heart. I mean, who the hell would keep a half cat half human anyway? But even with the charming brat lighting up Levi's life, he was ripped away from him too soon. Where did Eren come from and who wanted to take him back again? Ten years, it took ten years for Levi to have any sort of clue as to where the boy was. Problem was, he wasn't a boy anymore. Instead, he was a man who was seeking Levi out and get him to love him again. (Basically, Eren is half human half cat. Levi hates it but ends up loving the boy. When Eren disappears for ten years and suddenly comes back, Levi doesn't know what the heck to do. He's not a boy anymore :) )"

"Staying alive means hiding your true self. This is the harsh truth that Armin Arlert has learned to live with since the day he was born. In a cruel world bent on hunting him down when all he really wants is to belong, the young shifter has been forced to run and hide his real nature from others like him.

Then we‚Äôll talk.‚Äù With that, he disappeared down one of their hallways, leaving Mikasa to stomp up the stairs and then slam her door shut, causing the picture frames on her wall with her and her parents to rattle.

Insanity flashed in her eyes, and she leaned in even closer, ignoring the knife Levi held at her throat.

But, alas, Imelda longed for so much more than the life she had. She longed for the freedom that the Walls she lived in barricaded her from. She longed to fly as free as a bird. When the opportunity to break out of the confines of Wall Rose presented itself in the form of the Scout Regiment, Imelda jumped at the chance she was given. Little did she know that she would meet people that she would soon come to call her family. Little did she know that she would fall in love with a broad-shouldered, gentle-smiled boy with pain swirling in his coffee eyes. And little did she know that the boy she loved with everything she had, would turn out to be the very enemy that she and the Scouts were battling tirelessly against. updates aren‚Äôt very long, but i update weekly (sometimes more)!"

She was certain that someday she'd have a moment like that, where she'd lock eyes with someone and know.

And though he may not have had feelings for her in the beginning, he's beginning to think he might just develop them along the way. And maybe, along the way, she will too.

Just so if it turns out I can't continue this, it won't be hanging unfinished like my other fic. :'> This will be the introduction/prologue of sorts to the Mike/Rose(OFC) centric one-shots I'll be writing. I also might add another work for some one-shot interactions between her and the 104th because I've had a few daydreams about that too. And maybe in the future, I'll actually be able to piece everything together into one big story and have a grand plot because I already have a few bits and pieces of it in mind."

But when things change, will he be able to keep his heart in check? Or will an unresolved obsession spiral out of control?"
"""We were so happy."" The thoughts are a mantra in his head as they return to the Scouting Legion's HQ - only to find their happiness to be cut short in ways they never even considered. And when it comes down to it, Levi just can't quite be strong. Not when his lover, his husband is about to die."
"For as long as Eren has known Jean - even when he knew him as Jeanice - Eren has had feelings for him. He admires Jean from a distance, wondering what makes the books Jean reads in class capture his attention, and desperately hoping to learn from it. Eren keeps his distance, until he's confronted with Jean's suicide note on Facebook and the possibility that Jean could die without ever knowing how important he was to Eren. Without thinking, Eren sets out to stop Jean before it's too late, and when he does, both their lives change forever in ways Jean could have never dreamed."
"Jean's love for her was white, red and black."
"Everywhere Jean‚Äôs eyes land, it‚Äôs gray. The water, the sky, the railings. They would be making landfall soon. He‚Äôs almost home. Four years. That‚Äôs how long it has been. He never thought he‚Äôd see its shores ever again. He doesn‚Äôt want to. - (Modern AU. In which Jean comes back home to Paradis after four years abroad to finally deal with his demons and finds everyone he knows and loves are wrestling with their own.)"

"Everything about Conservator Operative Levi Ackerman is neat. His pinstripe suit, his tightly laced shoes and perfectly combed hair ‚Äì jet black with a precise parting at the centre. His work is no exception. He is polite and inconspicuous. He corrects mistakes with little fuss, quietly returning lost house keys to their owners, smoothing creases in library books, and dismantling fire hazards. He smoothly morphs his dialect to blend in any era and location. Most importantly of all, he follows the rules. (Except sometimes. Because Erwin Smith.) An AU in which Time Traveller Levi is rather sick of his job, and even more sick of fighting his feelings for Erwin. The remaining chapters of this WIP will be posted when the fic is finished in its entirety!"
"'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair.' With Hange still in recovery, Levi is left to deal with the aftermath of Erwin's death. But is humanity's strongest soldier equipped to deal with the challenges that come his way, namely, warchief Erwin Smith?"
"years after, levi and historia finally talk about those they've lost"
"Maria High is a high school like any other, with its infuriating teachers, dull classes, disgusting cafeteria meals and‚Ä¶ cliques. Levi Ackerman is a junior and member of the loser clique. Extreme bullying by the popular kids, the athletic jocks and the beautiful cheerleaders, is part of his daily life. The school year promises to get very interesting when he starts tutoring German to fellow student Erwin Smith, captain of the baseball team and jock extraordinaire. Erwin seemingly has it all: great looks, a full wallet, a large friend group, and bountiful attention from the ladies. What he also has is a big secret, which if anyone is ever to find out, might change his life for the worse."
"The stories of Petra Ral and Levi Ackerman and how they fell in love across every universe."
"A journalist searching for meaning meets a painter who lost his. Destiny is overrated, but is it absolute?"
"When you went to bed, you were an athletic trainer living in California. When you woke up, you were in the year 850, in a different world, surrounded by people and monsters even your imagination couldn't conjure up.  You thought your life was hard before, try not having running water."
"You could never understand why everyone loved Hange so much, but after you were basically forced to work side by side with them, you realize they might not be that bad."
"Pieck waked up from a horrid dream. Although it happened years ago, it still haunts her."
"Let's make a deal, I forgive you as you forgive me too"
"In the summer, a little girl goes missing in Paradise. In the fall, Armin Arlert and his friends enter their final year of high school with the case still unsolved. The town struggles with how to move on. But for Armin, the biggest question is who the new girl in his class is-- and how does she have such beautiful eyes?"
"Petra Ral has been on Squad Levi for years now, and grown accustomed to her makeshift family that is the special ops group. But when an impromptu trip into Captain Levi's past brings them closer than before, she can't help the feelings that begin to bubble up for her stoic captain. And it looks like he feels the same way. A relationship between a captain and their subordinate would be strictly prohibited, so they were better off staying as they were, friends and teammates. As long as they swallowed their feelings, everything would be fine...right?"
"In the winter following the reclamation of Wall Maria, the New Levi Squad is sent on a mission to restock an old outpost up north, and as a result of the close quarters, impatience rises up among the group. On a completely unrelated note, Eren keeps slipping further and further from his squad. Both of these problems are struck head-on by a reindeer that decides to latch on to Eren out in the cold. Levi is not a fan. Prompt 1: rescuing a reindeer"
"H. Strongest, a striving author, finds himself in a state in which every author has been before. He has an extreme case of writer's block. So extreme, in fact, that he actually needs to go outside for inspiration. Maybe then he'll be able to find someone to become the main character for his new book. And that's where Eren comes in."
"You‚Äôre pregnant with Levi‚Äôs child but you‚Äôre told that if you have this child, you‚Äôre likely to die in labor. You told Levi that you‚Äôre planning on having it but he assumed you‚Äôd come around eventually. He was wrong. When he sees your determination, he starts to get desperate."
"In the village of Enderall, a fairytale passed down for generations warns them of the full moon. *Attack on Titan & Red Riding Hood crossover*"
"HIATUS. Years had past, yet the memories you had willed away begrudgingly remained. As the new teacher at Trost daycare, you hadn't exactly expected to be given the role of looking after the children of your now grown former friends from the 104th grad class. Yet as the poets say, fate is set in stone. And the pulling connection Jean Kirstein had always felt, was still there. By god, even Shakespeare knew it."
"A spy sent from Marley, your mission is to infiltrate Paradis and establish yourself in their military, ready to aid the Warriors' upon their arrival. While you may have trained your entire life for this, nothing could have prepared you for the rift that would form within you after spending years in Paradis. With the weight of humanity on your shoulders, you make the choice to continue on your mission, but will there be anything left of you beneath the lies and delusions you've buried yourself in?"
"If Levi needs to push him away, he will let him have his space. If he needs to be angry at him, he will let him be angry, and soothe him so long as he allows it. But if he needs him to stay, he will not, because if he does, they will both regret it. And when they begin regretting, they begin resenting, and when they start resenting each other, then they will start losing each other. So tonight, all he can do is wait for him to come back. He will tell him what he needs to, and nothing more. They don't have much left, but this was for the best. Or, Erwin and Levi struggle to process recent events and grapple with their feelings, in light of the uncertainty that either or both of them could be dead after the mission to retake Wall Maria."
"Levi knew that he would lose at least one person he cared deeply for in shiganshina and he was determined to make sure that the one he cared for most stayed safe and out of harm's way."
"After Eren was ready to start a new life, he moved into a house. Along the way he meets Levi and they quickly seemed to feel drawn to each other. The only problem is that the place Eren is now calling his home, had an unwanted quest, who had been there longer than he had."
"Levi isn't the one she truly wants and he knows it; they're good at using each other for other means. She think she's gotten away with it, until she runs into Eren on her way back. If she could change her mistakes, she would, but they're irreparable now. She can only hope that Eren doesn't find out what would certainly hurt him most."
"People always tell you to enjoy what you have, the bright yellow sunlight that bounced off your skin and radiated you in a beautiful orange light. The way the grass blades gracefully sway in the wind and pink azalea flowers that bloom and surround the big strong trees accompanied with heathy green colored leaves. But Levi couldn‚Äôt see any of it. All he saw was gray. Hundreds of gray hues. But never an ounce of color. Levi couldn‚Äôt decide if that was a curse or a blessing. What difference did it make? The world he lived in wasn‚Äôt meant to be beautiful. Blood stained every single thing in this world. Or Colorblind Levi au tw// small mentions of implied s*lf h*rm"
"The Rumbling ended, it was the end of years of battle. They could finally rest. The survey corps, or what was left of them, were flying back to Paradis. Levi, while cleaning Hange's room, finds a letter."
"Jean didn't think he would find himself in the freckled principal's office as often as he was. Just goes to show history truly does repeat itself. Jean isn't too sure if he minds all that much though, because he slowly finds himself falling for the man behind the desk. And his daughter knows it."
"The world is overrun by zombies. Fate leaves you stranded on the roof of a semi-truck with a certain gruff stranger. Yet for some reason, the thing that feels most absurd is the thought of leaving him behind."
"Herein lie scenes from certain moments of ‚ÄòIn Sickness and Buffoonery‚Äô played from Erwin‚Äôs perspective."
"The day Levi accidentally saw his older sister and her boyfriend fucking was the start of his and Eren‚Äôs chaotic, hidden relationship. And God forbid Mikasa ever finds out that Levi enjoys being dicked down by her boyfriend or else he‚Äôd have no place to live in."
"‚úß His life might be short, but you‚Äôd always be by his side to celebrate his birthday.

"Some people are destined for each other, and some people happen to meet. Some people's eyes spark at the first eye contact and some people's burn in hatred. Some people are made to work side by side, and some people are forced to endure the presence of each other. Some people love each other, and some people try to hide their feelings behind prejudice."

"He‚Äôs smart, but you‚Äôre smarter. His willpower is strong, but you could hold out for longer. He thinks he‚Äôs the best at the game, but he‚Äôs never played with you.

"Levi knew that in a struggle between life and death, it was always the person who needed life the most who would end up winning. And as he stared into her tear-filled eyes, he saw how desperate she was for it. For life. The year is 845. Wall Maria has just been breached, but titans later turn out to be the least of the people's worries. The Underground and the Aboveground are on a collision course, and Captain Levi suddenly finds himself swept into the mess. When his student is kidnapped by a Sina lord, Levi has to team up with other immigrants from the Underground to save her. He doesn't expect to find out that she used to be the most famous prostitute in the Underground, one with a big dream and an even bigger responsibility ... which might end up unsettling the Sina nobility and the entire walled world ‚Äî including Levi himself. Accidental friends, love, and memories of home prompt Levi to question his loyalties: the Survey Corps, or the Underground Resistance? Being Humanity‚Äôs Strongest Soldier, or being human? Meanwhile, deep in the belly of the Underground, the old magic is waking up‚Ä¶"
"The kidnapping of his student leads Levi on a rescue mission with other former thugs from the Underground. Little does he know, the student used to be the Underground‚Äôs most famous prostitute ‚Ä¶ and his childhood crush. And she has an aptitude for magic. As the government and the Survey Corps plan the culling, the Underground is gearing up for an uprising, and they need leaders and allies. Who better to do it than humanity‚Äôs strongest soldier and his student soldier, the Underground‚Äôs finest son and daughter? Never mind that the dangers of the resistance will forever be a threat to their relationship. Accidental friends, love, and memories of home prompt Levi to question his loyalties: the Survey Corps, or the Underground Resistance? Being humanity‚Äôs strongest soldier, or being human?"

"Squid game contains a set of games where players can win money, getting them out of their debts and rich enough to do as they please for eternity. But if you lose, you'll die a horrible death. It's been three rounds, and after losing many friends along the way, Eren makes it his goal to make sure that his best friend Armin is safe at all costs. And that is exactly what he plans to do when the remaining players get told to pair up in teams of two. A very sad Eremin au that can only end with one survivor."

However life in Shiganshina isn't peaceful for long as you find yourself thrown back into the battle between titans and humanity. Will you ever be able to achieve peace? ... Carla Jaeger is a MILF and if you're here I hope it's because you agree. Technically a fem!reader but mostly can be read as androgenous."

As a result, Alphas adapted to be able to breed with not only Betas, but other Alpha‚Äôs as well.  The world spiraled into utter chaos due to the virus, wars broke out, causing whole countries to fall. Most of those alive today are the ones immune to the deadly virus. Many of the world is now a waste land. Completely destroyed from the years of war.

"Canonverse snippets of life in survey corps. Each chapter is a stand-alone. Basically a place for me to store my head-canons, plot-bunnies and short fics. Varying length and genre. Anything can happen. Levi-centric but all my favourite characters will appear. Some chapters contain Eruri. More Eruri in later chaptes. --- I wrote these years ago after being sick for a long time. I lost most of my ability to write while being ill, these fics were written during my recovery as a way to practice and regain my ability to write. I have hundreds, the quality varies and some are only partially finished but I've finally mustered up the courage to post some of them."
"ALTERNATE TIMELINE: What if Eren hadn't gotten there to rescue Mikasa in time?"
"The end begins in the way it came."
"‚ÄúWhat do you think about all the time we‚Äôve spent together? - I wish it could go on and on forever. I‚Äôll never get tired of being with you. - One should never say ‚Äònever‚Äô. - It seems like we‚Äôre the annoying exception, then. ‚ÄòCause I can say for sure that I‚Äôll never get tired of you.

"Before Eren and Mikasa get married, Mikasa wants to find her father‚Äôs side of the family first, and like the supportive fianc√© he is, Eren is there for her every step of the way. Of course, Eren never expected that he would end up falling in love with her much older cousin."
"Before Eren and Mikasa get married, Mikasa wants to find her father‚Äôs side of the family first, and like the supportive fianc√© that he is, Eren is there for her every step of the way. But upon meeting her mysterious cousin, Eren‚Äôs world spirals out of control. He is thrown into the exhilarating chaos of Levi‚Äôs dark world, and becomes addicted to the unhindered freedom that he finds in every fight he gets into, unleashing his true self under Levi‚Äôs guidance. So Eren finds himself drowning in lies, after all, he was really not supposed to fall in love with his fianc√©e‚Äôs much older cousin."
"Being a Kirschtein means commanding the respect of the community, having the money to rub in people's faces, and possessing the intelligence to keep the family legacy thriving. And Jean wants absolutely nothing to do with that. Except maybe the respect. Legacy follows Jean, Marco and their friends as they stumble through college and different challenges for all of them. Between parental pressure, disease, awkwardness, and just shitty situations, these kids find love and bond together and learn to live for themselves and make their own future. A story with enough fluff to cushion the angst and humor to keep everyone sane in between."
"‚ÄúIt was rare. I was there. I remember it all too well.‚Äù It's been years ever since the magic of the titans is long gone. Revisiting past memories of the life she lived with an enigma that is Eren Jaeger had never been this hard for Mikasa Ackerman. Loving him was nothing but red, and yet every time, they both still foolishly wished for the ending to change what could've been."
"Eren has travel back five years and now he can fix the opportunity he missed to find his father as well as the truth behind his disappearance. So, it's time to take a different path. Cue the action music! This one's in for a fun adventure! Time for a story of self discovery, fun-loving quests, dangerous adventures, deep-bonded friendship, cryptic messages, deep secrets, thrilling mysteries, and so much more! but things aren't so sunshine and rainbows with Eren as the deeper he dives, the less he is to return. But he can't back out now, not when he's so close and accomplished so much. Maybe it's time to rely on others for a- nope, there he goes. Nevermind, Eren's too stubborn to rely on anyone. Or maybe..? Wait! did he just die!? Jesus Christ"
"Eren has travel back five years and now he has fix what he couldn't before. That being said, why are so many people sticking to his side? It's not like he did magic, which he now knows how to use. Why are they so surprised? Why is Mikasa hating on her cousin? Why won't Zeke leave? Why is a short scary captain so adamant on his safety? Okay, maybe Eren changed much more than he realize."

"I write a lot of monologues a lot lately.. Stupid drabbles, agh. I like the idea of both Petra's and Auruo's love being unrequited. No happy endings here..."
"Now with added Jean's POV as a second chapter. I changed the title because I've just realized there's a tanyart fic with the same title and I felt like a dork - I'm sorry, I'm terrible at naming things. For a prompt on the SNK kink meme - Jean fucking Eren in a shitty black wig and the both of them pretending it makes Eren look like Mikasa. Somewhere in my brain it short-circuited with some of my own old issues and the result is this. Eren will try to make things good for Jean, despite everything. But it seems he doesn't need to try too hard, after all."

But for the first time ever, there was someone else there: a child with haunting eyes and a patchwork scarf.

"The blood would never wash off, it never did. No matter how long or how hard he tried, his hands would always be stained with blood."
"The world around Levi finally caves in completely. It's all disappearing bit by bit, scream by scream right before his eyes and this time even he is not fast enough to save everyone. His only option, only way to stop the world from hurling into an abyss is holding it on his own shoulders, by becoming the very thing he hates, the very thing he needs to destroy."
"I really must be getting old. I let out a hollow chuckle to the empty room. Waking up early has its merits. At least none of these brats will see me like this. It‚Äôs better that they see me as the invincible hero that I‚Äôm known as; not this tired, broken old man. Takes place in the current manga timeline; possible spoilers."
"Bertholdt had always had nightmares, but Reiner would always be there for him, right?"
"Armin is a pain at parties. He doesn't even like them very much. But he comes all the same, because it's nice to be with Eren and it's nice to get plastered and doing both is even better."
"Actions speak a lot louder than words - that was a saying that you and the Captain lived by, for sure. As Levi‚Äôs personal assistant, you showed the whole world just how much he meant to you through little actions and meticulous gestures, accommodating for every one of his needs and quirks while making it seem effortless. All the while, Levi was oblivious to it all. He didn‚Äôt notice that his work was getting finished earlier, that he was sleeping more hours, that he was finally eating every meal of the day. His life was just better with you by his side. But all this changed when you were promoted. Levi no longer had someone to make his perfect cup of tea, or run around HQ dropping off papers and setting the most efficient schedule. You had a squad to look after, and Levi had a new (less than substantial) assistant. Realising just how much you did for him might have come too late as the both of you learn how distance really does make the heart grow fonder."
"Levi Ackerman has no idea why every time it rains, he feels really, really miserable. He didn't expect his new neighbor who has just moved in next to his apartment to show him the reason, either. Like literally. Or, just one more Reincarnation fic for the OTP."
"Really, Eren expected this relationship to go to hell. Living in a world filled with titans causes one to understand that Death could be around any corner. It's just, Eren did not expect Death to hit him, or rather Bertholdt, in this specific way. Nor did Eren expect to be betrayed by the one person that should have never betrayed him."

"A ridiculous rhyme I just spun to be the overarching title for this collection of fics written for Jeanmarco Month 2017. Numerous aus, some canon, lots of fluff, probably a healthy helping of angsty so your teeth don't rot. A whole lotta Jeanmarco in an itty bitty living space. That's what you'll find here."
"JeanMarco Month, Day 1 (June 7): Reunion/Fate (Zombie Apocalypse AU, ""Survey Corpse"") In the course of only a few days, the world as Jean Kirschtein and his friends knew completely fell apart. The dead don't stay dead--and worst of all, that includes Jean's little sister Ella. Now Jean must try to survive and avoid the smothering guilt he feels, and the only person he trusts is a kid named Marco. But Marco has his own issues himself...just not in the same way Jean does."
"When she looked back, she could remember him from the funeral. He had not stood out back then, not like the weeping woman walking just behind the casket, too young to have lost a son. Not like the woman walking beside her with a small child in her arms - one, that she would hopefully never have to bury."
"JeanMarco Month, Day 4 (June 10): Modern Day AU After a night of drinking and talking, Marco Bodt and his best friend Jean move onto deeper conversations...as in romance. And the thing that Marco wishes most of all right now is that he could be brave enough to tell him how he really felt. Oneshot/drabble"
"After Bertholdt's death, he finds himself where he least expected. In the midst of his emotional turmoil, a familiar face appears before him. *Based on a piece of fan art that I found and cried over *"
"SnK AU in which Marco and Jean live a relatively peaceful life together, battling insecurities."
"Eren realised he was different since his early childhood. He didn't know different how... just different, not that it mattered much to him, as much as it seemed to confuse everyone else. Though he never anticipated exactly how much more confusing everything could become until Levi came into the mix. (aka Eren has no clue how to deal with his queer feelings, or even how to begin to figure himself out when it comes to what he feels for Levi.)"
"Losing Petra and his Squad deeply affected the infamous Captain, but how does he cope when he starts seeing her again?"
"You see the date on his wrist says the 3rd of April 2035, but the date right now is the 4th of April 2035. Jean Kirstein was supposed to die yesterday."
"Eren is dying. A harsh fact that the survey corps would have to come to terms with."
"Problem child Eren Jaeger meets his match when Levi moves in next door. The two youngsters find friendship quickly and go through the ups and downs in a world of Alphas, Betas, and Omegas. An Alpha and Omega set of best friends includes its own plethora of struggles and misunderstandings. Tested with the trials of growing up, they find joy in the darkness and learn that there is no better sanctuary than in one another."
"Shiganshina, a district abandoned by the monarchy after the Fall of Maria, was expected to fade and decay, along with all it's people. But three children refused to die- even if survival costs their humanity. Eren Jaeger finds himself struggling for sanity in the face of his mother's death; Mikasa Ackerman simply wants to hold her tattered family together. And Armin Arlert's plans may mean the salvation, or demise, of all mankind. Alternate Continuum/ AU- Canon Divergence ON HOLD indefinitely, though I‚Äôm not going to say abandoned, because that would break my heart; I do hope to finish this some day, but that day is not currently within sight)"
"Eren's a mildly depressed teen just starting college. Levi is his lecturer. Thanks to the past, Eren can't accept happiness. No, he hates himself too much for that, but Levi keeps sticking his nose in and Eren doesn't understand what the man really wants. Eren's POV"
"Levi rushes to the wall in the aftermath of the Armored and Colossal Titans' attack. ‚ÄúAre you worried about your wife?‚Äù The question shocked him out of his musings. Levi looked up, ‚ÄúMy what?‚Äù But the pastor was already speaking, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre obviously beside yourself with stress ‚Äì and it‚Äôs understandable. Not knowing if your wife has survived-‚Äù Levi cut him off, ‚ÄúMy what?‚Äù The pastor hesitated, apparently realizing he‚Äôd made some mistake, but misunderstanding precisely what it was. ‚ÄúYour‚Ä¶wife? The woman we traveled with before? She‚Äôs ah ‚Äì forceful. You two uh ‚Äì have the same, er ‚Äì strident personality. When we first met, she dangled me off the wall.‚Äù"

"Levi feels alone."
"Levi is leaving. Based off the prompt ""I don't hate you. I never could hate you. That's the problem."""
"Out of all the things Eren Jaeger had expected to be in his adult life, haunted was not one of them. And yet. He drew the covers up to his chin as if they'd protect him from whatever was clanging around in his new apartment, trying not to yell out loud. He'd never been so terrified before, not even when he'd had to kill those two thugs to save his sister. At least he'd known what those thugs were like an how to attack them, but a ghost‚Äî? He considered calling Mikasa or Armin for help, but then he remembered that they were miles away. Even if Armin did come up with a plan, Eren would be dead already. Joy. How do you escape a ghost anyway? Maybe I can make it to the fire escape before it gets to me, he thought, grimly, as he straightened up. He didn't particularly want to see what it looked like, he just wanted to get the hell out of here before‚Äî ""Boo."" ""AAAAAARGHHH!"" He screamed, closing his eyes and lashing out as hard as he could. ""Oof! Ouch, kid, what the fuck?"" // Or the one in which Levi is a ghost and Eren is trying not to fall in love."
"Everyone has their 'one that got away'. For Levi Ackerman, it was Eren Jaeger. Levi never meant to hurt the love of his life. And now with Eren gone, Levi doubted he could survive without the boy. Fast forward to five years, the two cross paths again. Levi realized he could mend things with his lost lover but that wasn't going to be easy. Eren was a very much changed man now with a beautiful future waiting for him that did not include Levi. However, Levi wasn't one to give up easily. He would make Eren fall for him again. Or atleast, he'd die trying."
"I stay long after everyone as left, long after the fire has smoldered out and drenched the field in darkness.  I sit down finally, and pull my knees up to my chest.  I have no idea how long I've been out here and I'm so close I should be able to feel the residual heat of the embers, but nothing touches my chilled skin."

"Ever wondered what a modern AU where Erwin Smith is head of a funeral home would look like? WELL LOOK NO FURTHER! This might sound twisted/funny. And I assure you it will be twisted, and it might even be funny from time to time. But there will be violence, smut etc. etc. at later chapters. You have been warned. Erwin is the head of the funeral home the Titan's Rest, he has recently recruited Levi who is acting as an assisstant of sorts to him. They are called in to get a body from the morgue. More exactly: the body of Carla J√§ger."
"‚ÄúYou did everything you could,‚Äù I say through the lump in my throat. My breathing is still labored and unnatural from nearby spirits wandering their way away from the flaming building. His tears drop into his lap as he shakily sighs, ‚ÄúThis is only the beginning,‚Äù he sniffs, ‚ÄúThere are much, much worse things coming.‚Äù -or- After a lifetime of seeing ghosts, Jean isn't scared by much. That is until he's damned with a prophecy that the world is going to end. What's he supposed to do about it? Who knows. But hopefully whoever this Marco Bodt is that everyone keeps talking about will have an answer or two."
"Eren Ja√´ger is 22 years old and a poker dealer at an elite casino in Las Vegas. One day an unfamiliar face shows up and Eren can‚Äôt help but be intrigued about this mysterious and aloof man. He‚Äôs dying to find out more, his judgment getting the better side of him. He may uncover truths that he wishes he hadn‚Äôt. They do say that curiosity killed the cat."
"MAJOR SPOILERS! This is what was going through Hannes's mind before he was killed by the Smiling Titan. This was written by my brother, it is his first thing he's ever written. Feel free to review!"
"Being in the Survey Corps was a death wish. Only those who were skilled enough to survive could fight against the titans, yet the heart of those soldiers are heavy. The man or woman standing next to you yesterday could be gone in an instant today. However, those lost will always linger among the tenebrous skies."
"Eren's a kid who would happily spend all his time in his wolf form. He loved the forest, he loved exploring, but most he loved napping in the sun. That was until a strange kid shows up out of nowhere, in his spot nonetheless, and Eren starts experiencing all sorts of things that leave him questioning just who he is. Lovelies, art is now up.

"Bertolt knows what his mission is and he has planned on going through without getting close to anyone but Reiner. Despite being a titan shifter, he is still human and he starts to grow attach to his fellow soldiers.

"As soon as he's back in Liberio, Reiner finds his father and his new family. Reiner can't explain to himself why he comes here. He doesn't know why he looked for his father and found him, why he watches him go about his mundane life from his hiding place. Sometimes he wonders what kind of life he could have if he were a Marleyan. Not a half-Marleyan, not an honorary Marleyan, but a real one. Would he be happier? Would he be a better person? Would he be a good brother to his siblings?"
"Levi is known for his taciturn, often belligerent air.  But when he dreams or fantasizes he‚Äôs a whole other person.  Now, he‚Äôs been badly injured and unconscious for days, his dreams have taken hold of his brain.  What are they trying to tell him?"
"Y/N L/N, beautiful, savage and deadly. In a school where assassination is taught as the primary topic, she thrives. But when her kingdom is challenged, can she survive? Or will she need help from the stoic, satirical Levi Ackerman along the way?"

"It was a beautiful day to die."
"It felt like it was too long since he had last seen Erwin. Things had definitely changed since then."
"""corporal,"" eren breathes, always careful with his tone because this was humanity's most formidable he was talking to. levi had every tactic, technique and whim under his belt to eliminate almost everything, including eren in his human state, but then, this has always been them - two rocks on opposite ends of thin ice. if either of them were to move even one centimeter, what they have holding them up would break. eren would rather not take that risk and it seems clear that levi has no intent on budging.

Now a chance meeting with a certain brilliant blond has put him in the position of keeping his feelings hidden once again. Will this time be any different? Can he risk that it won't? Its not right... After all I went through to get away from this back home, after all the trouble I caused... and now i'm doing it again? its not right for me to think of him that way. to put that pressure on him even in my head. to imagine doing that to him. it doesn't matter how i feel, i won't let you get hurt because of it, even if it means our status will remain as friends."
"The thought that he would never see Mike again was painful, there was no denying it. That smell, though, was at least of some comfort to Erwin, clinging to the pillows and the sheets, set deep into the bed itself. A tragic-romance drabble written for EruMike Week on Tumblr"

"I'm taking requests! The fandoms I am willing to fulfill requests for are posted in the fandoms section above. I will write just about any ship, with the exception of Voltron ships including Matt. I would love to write about Matt but I feel as though I haven't learned enough about him as a character yet. Sorry! As for the other fandoms, I will write just about any ship (companion-companion or companion-Sole surivor for Fallout 4 are both ok).

Which wouldn't be a problem, if he wasn't completely and totally gay."
"What is and what could be."
"An experiment with bondage doesn't quite work out as planned...."
"Levi had been dreaming of a man. A priest, whom he helps battle against monsters and creatures only found in fairy tales. He always dies. Levi can never save him. One day, he walks into a bookstore and sees the man he had only been dreaming of for months. Erwin had also been dreaming. He dreams of a half vampire who he saved from certain death.

Can true love survive this time around, or are these two men destined to live through the same fate over and over again?"
"On an expedition outside of Wall Rose, things mostly went well, except for one thing. Levi went missing. There is some hope that he is still alive since they could not find his horse or 3DMG, but hope is wearing thin as time passes."
"Images flashed before his eyes... Something not a part of his current reality; however, they felt to him like missing pieces of a distant past. ...And then of course he remembered the day the 104th training squad's newly-graduated trainees joined the Survey Corps. Amongst the groups of toughened teens strong-willed enough to join the Survey Corps, one stood out to Levi. It was a young brat, with the most indescribably bright, colourful eyes ever - eyes that told Levi he had seen things, seen many things - and messy, chocolate brown hair. He stood in the salute, proud and resolved, anger mixed with only the tiniest traces of fear. His face shining with hope and determination that Levi soon learned would continue on, even in the most dire of moments. --- ""I haven't found anyone except for you because I hadn't been looking. And I don't intend to."" Levi said that with a tone of finality in his voice, and Hanji took the hint. He had fully intended to keep things that way. But sometimes, life (be it your first or your hundredth) wanted to screw around with you. So obviously, he would have to find others."
"Before Levi dies, he asks to see the frozen lake"
"It was the shadows in his eyes that separated him from the rest. It's the walls around himself that made him unreachable even just from plain sight. It was the way he holds himself, the silent scream for help in the late hours that I saw how much he needed help. The shattered pieces of himself that he was holding in his scarred, bleeding hands, the shattered pieces of himself that I wanted to fix. Not to return it back to how it was before, but make it into something much, much more beautiful, filling in the lost shards with the love that I could give. He wore scars all over his body and soul, like tattoos on his skin, scars from all the battle he has won. And in my sight, it was his scars that made him beautiful."
"A terrible accident lands 18 year old Eren Jaeger in West Trost  mental institution where he meets his cold and mysterious room mate, Levi who refuses to open up at all what so ever to Eren. Who knew that this ill tempered man would become such an important part of his new life in the ward. Rating changes to explicit starting on chapter 11!"
"Levi has some doubts about this new plan, but Eren is there to help."
"There was once a pact between dragon and king in the northern kingdom where dragons lived at peace with human and creature alike. Alas, peace did not last and the old ways were lost to greed and power. King Grisha and his father before him waged war on the dragons, with no regard for hatchlings or old ones alike, and slayed them remorselessly for their hides. Though the dragons fought back fiercely and took as many and more mortal lives in retaliation, they were too few to withstand the tenacity of human beings. Only a handful remain, living in fear and in disgrace, existing in a world that has no place left for them. When the heir apparent, Eren Jaeger, is brought to the scaled witch in the briar wood to beg for his life, a new pact is formed. Levi, one of the last living dragons of legend, offers to spare Eren‚Äôs life in return for his promise to be a fair, just, and selfless king. But Eren grew into a selfish, arrogant, righteously angry young man now bent on revenge for the murder of his mother. Eren does not deserve the life Levi had so graciously given him, but there‚Äôs an honesty in him that is unmistakable. Maybe knowing his heart is not his own will change him. And maybe Levi will change with him."
"I skipped straight to day 6 of Rivetra week because I am really not in the right mindset to write the prompt for day 5 today. I'll go back and get to it tomorrow, but today you get this one.

"Reiner has a secret.  Well, Reiner, Bertholt, and Annie have a secret but only Reiner has a problem.  After the death of Marcel, Reiner does more than lose his mind; he begins to lose his dynamic. The more Reiner struggles with the loss of Marcel, the guilt over his actions, and the personae he must wear, the more his alpha dynamic weakens.  And that's a problem since only titan shifters present with a dynamic and Reiner's altering dynamic is dangerously close to blowing their cover. Faced with losing his best friend, Bertholt makes the decision to take Marcel's place as Reiner's anchor to remind Reiner that he is both a warrior and an alpha and to keep their mission intact.  All he has to do is submit. tl;dr: canon-compliant light ABO in which titan shifters can alter their dynamic with a little sexual encouragement."

"One-hundred-and-four shippy drabbles for the soul."
"It is dusk when they come home for the first time. He will remember this for the rest of his life. Petra is wearing a yellow dress, and there are white flowers in her hair. Her eyes are bright, and a little swollen because she cried when he said his vows to her. But her cheeks are flushed from laughing; she has laughed more today than he‚Äôs ever heard, and he is drunk on the sound of it. || an epilogue"

So with nowhere else to turn, she joins the Survey Corps and goes along for the ride."
"In which Mikasa's version of an unhealthy coping mechanism consists of making out with Jean every night while Eren is across the ocean in Marley."
"Jean is a lighthouse, but he is crumbling beneath the waves and he cannot hold Eren forever."
"""What?"" he asked, his voice trembling with emotion Eren will never probably understand. The kind of emotion you learn to feel with time, time Eren did not have. But he could say what he felt now, or at least try to. ""I always wanted to matter, always wanted to leave my mark here.. some kind of constant reminder to numerous generations that would follow. And now I did. I saved us. All of us. But I still feel so empty and worthless"" he fixed Levi with his gaze. The captain looked no less confused and frightened than before. Good, that's just how Eren felt about him. A story about happiness and sorrow, confusion and understanding, love and fear -and two men who conquered all of it."
"Mikasa relishes in her newfound sense of freedom. Loneliness does not mean she is alone. A prequel and sequel to Home and I Know (I Am the One in Love)."
"It had been 2am when Erwin awoke to the sound of Levi‚Äôs quiet sobs and sniffles, hand covering his mouth in attempt to silence his cries. His body shook, though Erwin‚Äôs arm steadied him, circled around his waist, nose pressed into his soft black hair. Levi had been having nightmares recently, conjuring up some old, unwanted memories, things he would have rather kept in the back of his mind."
"Rising in popularity, the band No Name takes some time to convalesce after their most recent tour.  Levi finds himself battling his demons and exhaustion at a beach side Bed and Breakfast that is closed for the off-season.  The only drawback to his self-imposed solitude?  The property's caretaker, Erwin, an obnoxious dick who seems to want nothing more than piss Levi off.  But Erwin has some demons of his own.

"Mikasa returns home after months of being away and the loneliness of her apartment eats her away."
"Levi is a beta. That‚Äôs what everyone around him thinks, because Levi has been suppressing his omega-dynamic with illegal suppressants from the Underground for as long as he‚Äôs been able to. Even when Erwin recruits him into the Survey Corps, a corps that accepts and embraces omegas without questioning, Levi keeps his dynamic a secret. It‚Äôs all fine, really. It works and nobody suspects a thing, until Levi loses all he‚Äôs ever had and starts slipping endlessly. He only finds consolidation in the arms of his commander, Erwin Smith, but is Levi ready to open up? Time will tell."

When the wind picked up, Levi spoke. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt lose you too.‚Äù As a statement, it was simple, straightforward, impossibly candid. Below, Connie sat with Sasha‚Äôs broken body. In her experience, a gentle lie was infinitely worse than a cruel truth, and so she said, ‚ÄúYou might.‚Äù The hand on her leg reflexively squeezed."
"""Hey, Eren, go see the ocean. I'll be with you forever and everywhere."""
"If given the chance, most people want to repeat one moment. Whether to change the outcome, relive the memory or some other stupid reason. Jean wanted none of that, wanted to get over anything and everything concerning Marco Bodt. But fate, per usual, didn't seem to give two shits about what he wanted. Really, he should‚Äôve known better than to hope this time would be different."

The Corporal is his only hope - a whirlwind of anxiety, release and sex - but things have become complicated and using his body seems to be the only way out. If that was what he had to do to forget, to keep his ever-running mind from running itself into the ground, then he'd do it. He had to be useful, yearned for it, because a titan wouldn‚Äôt spare its next meal just because it was smart."
"For a moment, he meets Eren‚Äôs eyes. They size each other up, or check each other out, Levi can‚Äôt tell."

After moving away from home and living on his own for two years, Jean bumps into Marco again, away from the supervision of his strict parents in, of all places, a laundrette.

"Eren had always thought that Armin would never return to him. It'd been four years since he disappeared - why would he come back? It was pointless to hope. That is, up until Armin resurfaced.

"Mikasa hates Eren. She hates that he left without a trace and she hates that he came back. She hates that he's different and she hates that she has no control over just how much she feels for him. Eren hates Mikasa. He hates her indifference to him and her new outfit and the fancy house she now lives in. He hates that she acts like they don't know each other and he hates that he still cares about what she thinks of him. They're both reaching for something that disappeared a long time ago."
"He wanted to change things, make them better for Armin, for Mikasa. But he was scared, so scared that one little change would cause their deaths. If he really wanted to change things, he would have to actually think things through. It would be the first time that had happened in a few years for Eren instead of following the script he had laid out. After a few minutes of thinking, Eren knew his plan. It would take a lot of risks, but it was better than letting Mikasa live on without him. He would require everyone and their individual skills to complete his plan. All he had left to do was to get everyone together to start it. He had no idea how to do that. He would have to take another risk, he guessed. ---------------------- What if instead of the Rumbling, Eren has another plan? (Updates On Mondays)"

"There is a beast inside each of them. When newly enslaved Annie arrived at the Jaeger khalasar, she only had one mission in mind. Escape. But as the endless long night drew near, she found herself thrown in the mess of an ancient prophecy that spoke of another Great War. Along with her in this journey was: Mikasa, the devil‚Äôs wife, Sasha, the spymaster, Pieck, the fallen princess, and Historia, the high priestess. Annie knew the path ahead wouldn‚Äôt be easy, not when she started to question her own identity, and certainly not when a mysterious blue-eyed general was always watching her. And they are hungry."
"There is supposedly only one way to obtain a new daemon and that is to meet - and touch - your soulmate. Supposedly. So of course, Eren takes the fall of a fucking lifetime, taking a daemon bird down with him.

"Lillian ‚ÄúLily‚Äù Carter, you‚Äôre average gymnast teacher meets an unsatisfying end to her short life by the means of an oblivious truck driver. The irony of the trope is not lost on her. Aware that all humans are reincarnated into some form of fiction or literature, she is appalled to find herself being swept away into one of the most hellish stories she could think of. She however isn't given much time to acclimate as she is found without a citizenship and promptly tossed underground in the year 841. Her story however starts in the year 846. 5 years after her untimely death and ultimate arrival here on the wonderful island of Paradis, with the help of an Innkeeper with secrets, she finds her own found family and a decent paying job as a dutiful Courier of the underground. She has quickly garnered a reputation for being skilled and efficient; however the ever present leering gaze of the greedy underground District leaders and her own itching ambition to change the story for the better may cause her unseen encounters as her actions do in-fact have consequences. After all; a second chance is still a second chance."

Her game of happiness, every day when she thought it was another blessing from God, was disrupted by the sudden divorce of her mother and father. But her meeting with Eren Yeager sparked a glimmer of hope in her life again."
"There are moments when my affection feels too big, like it couldn‚Äôt possibly all fit in my small frame, like it must exist somewhere outside of myself. Somewhere, maybe inside of Eren, maybe out across the ocean, maybe in some other universe. The idea that Eren can‚Äôt feel it, that he doesn‚Äôt feel it too, can seem inconceivable during these moments. **** Eren is a 23-year-old artist/bartender with a secret only Armin and Mikasa know: he has a 50% chance of only living until middle age. Levi is a 34-year-old tea shop owner who is oddly attracted to the kid who keeps coming into his shop with a sketchbook. Lots of pining ensues."

"Erwin isn't popular by anyone's standards. The general population, as well as much of the Survey Corps tends to think that he's unfit to lead an army, but Levi sticks by his side no matter what - he would follow Erwin Smith anywhere. Basically, I just wanted to write something really long and sappy (and fluffy and smutty) about how much Levi loves Erwin."

It is over quick and fast, Levi doesn‚Äôt remember too much except for sweat and the taste of the kisses and how extremely clean he felt when Erwin came inside him with a choking, muffled grunt.

When Wall Maria falls, she follows her newfound family to the Survey Corps out of the need to protect them.

Humanity‚Äôs strongest soldier - Captain Levi. Her goal was to surpass him in every way possible - but with the threat of Titans and more looming in the distance, Miya must look past her biases and work together - even if that meant cooperating with the man she has tried to avoid thinking about for more than a decade."

"Just when the warrior thinks the girl will walk silently away, she turns around, dazzling him with her grey gaze. He quickly concludes that her eyes are not like stars. They are like distant galaxies in the universe that shine brightly, like sparks produced by the clash of the metal of two swords. ‚ÄúMy name is Mikasa.‚Äù She looks up at him with the corners of her lips turned up, her cupid's bow so deep and so‚Ä¶ captivating. ‚ÄúThe goddess of love and beauty‚Ä¶ or so they say.‚Äù ‚ÄúEren.‚Äù He says, introducing himself, after a few seconds that taste like an eternity. ‚ÄúGod of War.‚Äù In which the god of war falls madly in love with the goddess of love and beauty."

"Reiner woke up to the most beautiful face he‚Äôd ever seen in his life. The boy was tan, with brilliant blue-green eyes and long rich-brown hair. It was tied back in a low bun, with stray strands escaping to frame his sharp features ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù the boy asked. Reiner opened his mouth to answer, but instead of spewing words, he threw up on the boy‚Äôs lap. Reiner, a Marleyan fighter pilot, finds himself stranded in the country he was supposed to destroy and falling for one of the devils he was supposed to hate."
"‚ÄúWhoever can claim her first, wins.‚Äù They were the predators, and you were the prey. Four people were interested in claiming you as their own, but they had no idea what they were getting themselves into, and neither did you."
"‚ÄúFine.‚Äù Levi had given in, a ghost of a smile back on his lips as he led the two of them on the dance floor. Hand in hand, pretending that there‚Äôs no one in that room, mocking the innocent and pure bond that they had, ‚ÄúI suppose I shouldn‚Äôt deny the King his orders.‚Äù And again, this is how it ends: With two young dancers in the middle of their gymnasium, moving along with the song with such graceful steps, not a falter in rhythm as they have been doing it for years. If you listen closely, you can hear two hearts beating in rhythm as well. This is when Erwin fell in love. By holding Levi‚Äôs hand, swaying him around, the crown shining above his head as he lets out one of those giggles again."
"""Write me letters, right now,"" she proposes. ""Write to me as if you were away."" ""That's stupid."" ""You throw that word around like it means something to me."""

"You felt a light, almost reluctant touch to your skin as long fingers wrapped around your wrist‚Äînot tight enough to hurt by any means, but unexpected enough to make you falter to a pause in your stride. You turned, glancing curiously back over your shoulder to see who was preventing you from leaving the party that you‚Äôd never even wanted to attend in the first place. You couldn‚Äôt have imagined it would be him who was standing there. Not after so much time had passed. Eren."
"We‚Äôd live together in an apartment that would face the sun in the mornings, harsh light streaming in through a window that I‚Äôd always swear was placed in a terrible spot. But then I‚Äôd see him lying beside me, basking in the warmth of dawn, and suddenly the window wouldn‚Äôt seem so bad."
"Shrugging Kenny's hand off, you took cautious steps towards this kid.  Standing at a safe distance, you knelt down in front of him.  Both your eyes met.  You stared at each other, unmoving with bated breath. ""You got a name?"" You asked softly.  Still not sure whether you were looking at a living person or a dead body.  His gaze bore into you, nearly devoid of life.  It was a cold stare, one that you were certain you'd never forget. ""Levi.  Just Levi.""  He barely spoke. OR: You grew up with Levi and this is your life with him as the events of AoT unfold, with some smut sprinkled in if I feel like it."
"You‚Äôd follow him to the end of the world, you promised, only to realize how silly the words sounded with the current state of life- not to mention, you had said the same to Petra, a girl that met her fate with zombies gnawing the flesh of her thigh. The world is cruel, you decided early on. The most you could do was hope you didn't turn into one of those monsters, that someone would have mercy on your soul and kill you before it happened."

"‚ÄúThat was the moment Armin knew that him and Eren were never really quite the same, that their dreams were never mutual.

Ymir, Marco had called her before. Ymir started walking closer, close enough for Historia to see the freckles dotted across her face and her sharp cat-like eyes that made her legs all wobbly and unsteady. Her hat was covering most of her head, but Historia could make out her brown hair that was styled in a small ponytail with a couple strands let out. It was clear to say that Historia had never felt this way before as she noticed the sound of her heart beating blurred her hearing, making it hard to hear anything. It was clear to say Historia has never felt this way before.

He briefly clenched his jaw, something unspeakable passing in his eyes. ‚ÄúGod‚Ä¶‚Äù He muttered, and then leaned forward and licked the tears off with one quick movement.

And for almost a whole minute Eren thought he was fighting for himself and not for some shitty commanding officer that had stupid blonde plastic girls hanging off there every word. or AU where Eren should be in a mental hospital and Levi tries to be invisible by making the exact opposite statement, fucking hypocrite."
"Levihan at the beach. Warning!! it's sad."
"Mikasa looked up at Armin with trembling eyes, ‚ÄúYeah, okay‚Ä¶‚Äù She stared at the couple standing across from them, taking in the sight, engraving it in her heart. Armin looked at her with sorrowful eyes. Mikasa took a deep breath, looking into Armin‚Äôs eyes again, ‚ÄúWell this is gonna hurt like a motherfucker.‚Äù That was a year ago. Mikasa had always had a thing for Eren, but she knew she wasn‚Äôt his type. Or she got the hint that he simply just wasn‚Äôt interested in her, due to the fact that she was one of his best friends, along with Armin of course. Eren had plenty of girlfriends all his life. He reached his peak in high school and that‚Äôs when he began dating like crazy. A new girlfriend almost every few months. None really lasted too long and he seemed like he was more in it for the sex. Whenever he was single though, she would try and make a move on him. Eren never caught on or reciprocated anything for her and Armin was stuck in the middle. Staying silent most of the time, telling himself that he had two of the dumbest friends."
"One hundred years ago, the people of Eldia were forced to hide. Their magic was wiped out by the world, and almost none remains. Eldians were rid of. Or, so they thought. Eren and Mikasa stumble across the kingdom in an attempt to escape the wrath of the outside world. With almost no recollection of their past lives, they are forced to make the most of what they have. When the prince of Eldia discovers them in the woods, pieces start to fit, and mysteries start to unfold."
"""Which duchy am I infiltrating?"" Levi thought the mission was going to be like any other mission he has done. He thought he'll be back to his old life after he finished it. But as chaos ensued with his subordinates and friends' lives on the line, and when his own personal life got caught in the messy business of espionage, his principles and beliefs were put to the test."
"One will forget the other, that's how it had to be. Historia's life depended on it, depended on them never meeting. So what happens when they cross paths again? Who forgot the other?"

"Grief is like the ocean; it washes over you in a wave, often one you can see coming, and it swallows you, dragging you into the depths so you forget which way the surface lies. It leaves you choking, gagging, desperate for air, and if you relent, you sink deeper, surrounded by blue. Levi has seen grief before. He knows that ocean, has swum in it, sunk in it, drowned in it more times than he will ever want to count. And he sees another wave rising, ready to crash over him as the ocean swells at his feet. He is a boat at the mercy of all that blue, and she has never shown him mercy before. - A retelling of canon from Levi‚Äôs perspective, Levi watches Erwin make a decision that will wrench his life apart forever, leaving Levi in tatters he is not sure he can put back together in his wake."

"For Reiner Braun, there is no girl closer to his heart than his older sister of 5 years: (Y/n) Braun.  They're inseparable--like peanut butter and jelly. Their mother Karina starts pushing for (Y/n) to join the Warrior Cadets--but she doesn't want to. Feeling conflicted about her background and the war between Marley and Paradis, (Y/n) flees her home--breaking the promise she made to Reiner: that she'd never leave him alone.

One day, when he goes to school, at some point, he accidentally bumps into the school's new heart throb, Levi Ackerman, who also happens to be the new guy around. And like most of Levi's fans, Eren develops a tiny little crush on the older boy. After their little bump in, Levi develops a huge crush on the timid, younger boy, feeling a need to protect him at all costs. So what happens when Levi finally finds out that people, both bullies and at home, have been hurting his sweet little Eren? He gets furious and kills them of course.

"As soon as the door closed Erwin opened his annoying mouth ""Stay away from Eren."" Levi cocked his brow. ""I mean it Levi, Eren will not be tainted by you."" ""Wow, Eren's right, you do have a parental-complex."" ""Stay away."" ""Yeah yeah whatever, can I go now?"" ""Hands to yourself, Levi"" was Erwin's last warning before he ushered Levi out the door.

"Year 861. Mikasa has found peace in the aftermath of the war, and learns to appreciate the joy in her life - despite everything she has lost."
"There was probably a time in Jean Kirstein's life where this wouldn't have seemed like an inevitable outcome. Now, he cant tell you when this time would have existed because whenever he does decide to be self- reflective it always seems like it was some predestined thing. Something that was set in stone from the moment  his father's DNA crossed with his mothers. That's not to say he woke up one morning and said ‚ÄúI'm going to be a drug dealer.‚Äù Because it's not how it happened. But it almost is that simple."

"Levi breaks down and Eren's there to provide soundless comfort."
"‚ÄúJEAN!!!! BEHIND YOU!!!!‚Äù Connie yelled but Jean didn‚Äôt have time to turn around as the seven meter-class titan picked him up. Jean‚Äôs eyes widened as he tried to struggle out.

In order to avoid a war against the immortal, humanity has agreed to give the few remaining Type O humans to the vampiric families. Eren Jaeger, one of these few Type O humans, has avoided the law for eighteen years before he is suddenly taken from everything he'd ever known and sold to a peculiar vampire.

"Multicolored eyes looked up, admiring the rock hard abs, the tattooed chest, the perfect neck, and then a pair of steel blue eyes. Those gunmetal orbs were looking at him like he was a piece of meat, just waiting to be devoured. His kissable, pierced lips parted and his voice was rough and husky. ""Do you want me, Eren?"" ----------- Love? Love was a bullshit word that meant nothing. Love was something Walt Disney made up to make money. Love was a lie, Love was weakness, Love was nothing. Or....at least that's what he kept telling himself every time he looked at that damn Brat with breathtaking eyes."
"Just as World War II ends, Europe tries to repair it's self from the devastation of the Nazi's. To Levi, Englishman Erwin Smith had always been a star too far from his reach. He always settled for the comfort of the German brat's bed followed by a morning of self loathing. His heart however always remained with Erwin. In which Levi makes himself suffer, Eren watches in love, and Erwin never says his own feelings or notices until it's too late. Levi works as a famous ballet dancer."
"Levi was on a business trip in New York City when he stumbled upon a young man in the rain."
"It doesn't happen for him like it does the rest of them. It isn't in his long winded deluded motivational speeches. It isn't in his reckless bravery or suicidal blue green eyes. It's not the way he bites his hand until it bleeds, the way he can take out 20 titans single handily in his monstrous form. It's not the hunch of his shoulders from the responsibility he carries, and it's certainly not in the way he tucks his father's key down the front of his shirt or tightens the belts around his legs. There's a lot of things it isn't, but could have been."
"Grisha Jaeger is a young man who already got to know how cruel the world can be. After the death of his little sister, the world seems like a dark and cold place, not only for him but specially for all Eldians, who are being haunted by their uncertain past.

Things get pretty angsty in later chapters."
"Since the loss of his friends, Levi doesn‚Äôt speak to anybody. He passes his freetime alone and he doesn‚Äôt seem interested on his other comrades‚Ä¶except for one."
"Jean's relationship with Eren has been starting to crumble, and to make things worse, he gets a horrible feeling that Eren might just be cheating on him.

All over the country, vampires are showing up dead, drained from twin holes on their necks. Nobody knows who is causing it, and the vampire world is being thrown into a state of panic. As the murders increase, it becomes obvious that the supernatural cops aren't doing their job, and Jean has never been one to sit around while shit goes sideways. (This is the sequel to Wow, That Sucks. I highly recommend reading that before this, but I'll do my best to make this understandable as a standalone.)"
"Levi is having a nigtmare and Eren helps him deal with his emotions. (Post-Female-Titan Arc)"
"Eren lives with the second-gender system that is evident wherever you go. Alphas are expected to fight, Betas are expected to work, in rare cases fight, and Omegas are expected to... do house chores and give offspring. Eren is an Omega, and he is one of the few rare people that don't accept the system. He won‚Äôt accept an Alpha or Beta partner who only desire him because of his ability to give offspring. He hates the thought of always having to do as he's told, and not being allowed to make a change, to fight. The Survey Corps are made from strong Alphas and are who Eren has always desired to fight with in his distant dream. At an annually held fare held for his heroes however, everything changes. Eren is dragged into the inner walls, leaving his friends and family behind, and is placed to work in a Maid Caf√©, with most of his customers being Alphas. One being the Alpha he has always looked up to, his ultimate hero, Levi from the Survey Corps. Note: Please be advised that this has VERY slow updates."

Eren is a college student just trying to get by in life with no desire to find his soulmate. But one day, after helping his friend Armin at work, he is walking home and accidentally bumps into a stranger. What he doesn't anticipate when he brushes shoulders with him, though, is a torrent of lost memories coming back to him‚Äîmemories of a terrifying, cruel world that was ruled by death and memories of something that had somehow become love."
"Commander Erwin Smith and (Y/n) are madly in love with each other. He promises to keep her safe but outside the walls promises like that are hard to keep."
"There are many things in life that give us questions. There are many things in life that give us immediate answers. There are many things that will never be answered. In the eyes of a carefree, low life blonde, dwelling on such things seems almost useless and invaluable. Why press for information that will never come out? Why work so hard if the solution is right in front of you? That‚Äôs the way she sees it at least. Maybe not for her bitter rival who sees fit to dig extra deep in everything that is thrown at her. It sickens the blonde, really. The way Mikasa Ackerman is so willing to do everything to meet perfection when she‚Äôs already got the brains and brawn to demolish the world. The way she works hard to look pristine to impress everyone around her. The way she has to show off every time she does something better than the small girl. Its Extra. Annie‚Äôs anything but extra. Annie Leonhardt is a slacker and doesn‚Äôt care that she‚Äôs a slacker. Annie just doesn‚Äôt care, or so she thinks."
"The war is won, and Erwin and Levi live out deep in the woods."
"It takes a long time for Levi to fess up to the marks that he's made."

"From the moment he saw that Titan snap his mother‚Äôs back and swallow her whole, Eren Jaeger had been determined to eliminate every last Titan ‚Äì a dream that had finally become a reality‚Ä¶ Or has it?"
"She can't go back. Not now, not ever."
"he thinks jean is adorable when he‚Äôs in denial. he can‚Äôt help but think that that blush and the unsatisfied frown and his loud yelling is pretty cute and he thinks he‚Äôs sick--lovesick--for some horse-faced asshole that he just wants to shut up by shoving a fist in his mouth, or something else."
"None"
"After Eren and Levi finally make their relationship ""official"", Eren wakes up with empty bedsheets beside him. Levi disappeared, only leaving a note, promising... ""You're my safe haven, so I'll return."" Eren slowly loses the trust and warmth they built up and goes into a state of confusion and depression. His mind continues to break down and he seeks that warmth in the numbing pain he causes himself. *Look in tags for triggers."
"‚ÄúWhat the hell is a firework, you shitty brat?‚Äù Levi in his bed-headed glory glares at the too-peppy Eren. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre like...how do I explain them? Flashes of light, and lots of sound, it‚Äôs really pretty, I promise! I wish you could‚Äôve seen what I saw in my dream. Hey, Corporal, when we obliterate all the Titans, let‚Äôs watch fireworks together!‚Äù Levi really thought that it would be possible; that was how bright Eren‚Äôs smile was. AU!"
"The more Mikasa learns about her, the less she knows. The closer she gets, the more entangled she becomes."
"Cradling Marco in his arms and lying sleepless in his bed became Jean's routine in the past months. With the painful cries still echoing in his ears, he cannot ease his mind in any other way but this."
"In which the question that's asked and answered is, what if Levi and Eren switched places (roles, ranks, ages, etc.)? Could we have a better outcome? The War against the titans is fierce, but this time around the insignia of freedom has not been completed. Lance Corporal Eren Yeager is well known as Humanity's Last Hope, due to the fact that he posseses no titan [shifting] powers but in a rage can cause them to cluster attack on a single one, a power granted to him by his father through an injection when he was at a young age. The Survey Corps regiment is still set on finding the basement. But everyone knows- Eren especially- that Hope is nothing without strength, reason being Humanity's Strongest Soldier has still not been found [Why it's not Mikasa will be explained]. Then, the Survey Corps are notified of a cadet who has the miraculous ability to shift himself into a titan; little do they know, this cadet is a rebellious brat who crosses way too many borders, ones that lead straight into Humanity's Last Hope's Heart."
"Jean and Marco have a mutual cuddle buddy relationship in order to cope with the dangers around them. --- This was honestly written for a writer's craft assignment last year, but I'm happy with how it came out. Just a little story, nothing much."
"""I, Eren Jaeger, am very certain on these few subjects when it comes to my sister's boyfriend. He's surprisingly short. He's ridiculously badass. His humor is shit. (No. Literally. He has shit jokes. And lots of them.) He's expressionless 95% of the time. He's addicted to Adam Lambert, Journey, Katy Perry, Imagine Dragons, and karaoke. I'm serious. (Never challenge him to karaoke.) He can sometimes be extremely over protective. When he smiles, it's beautiful. He's ripped. Like, six-pack-nice-arms-great-ass-mother-of-god-ripped. Yeah, he's hot. And I, Eren Jaeger, am 100% certain that I have fallen head over heels for my sister's boyfriend."""
"It might seem like a good thing, at first. Jean gets Marco back from the dead, but there's a time limit. He's only got three days before he has to let him go again. To make matters worse, Marco doesn't know."
"Since the battle of Trost,  Jean has been empty of any emotion. Trying as he might to repress everything, circumstances force him to remember all he has lost and make him realize that life won't ever be the same without Marco."
"In the late 1950s, in a small midwestern town where difference is condemned, Jean and Marco dream of a larger world and of a future where love doesn‚Äôt have to be hidden behind closed doors. A story of things lost and found, of journeys, of the magic of words and the meaning of silence."

"(Altenatively Titled: I'm Still Tied to You) Armin remembers everything from the time of the titans, the grotesque expressions of those wretched monsters to the large stone walls that caged everyone in like animals, the tragedy within those stone surroundings. Of course, he remembers the death, the mourning, that distinct smell of his comrades blood in the air. But he also remembers other memories, precious ones, one's of him falling in love with someone, marrying them, building a life with that person in that incredibly cruel  world that they'd lived in. He remembers Jean. But Jean doesn't have those memories."
"She wants to burn for him. It's the only thing that would make sense to her. Because if she can't have him and if she can't have life there is no point in doing something ever again. She imagines herself in his arms, both of them encased by flames which cannot touch them. She could accept the fire licking at her insides if it was for him."
"""That's just the way Eren is,"" Armin said, but Levi didn't buy it. No one was happy all the time. And then there was this weird feeling he got every time he saw Eren. Something was...wrong with him. After moving to Shiganshina Levi meets Eren, a 19 year old guy who never seems to stop smiling. Simply annoyed by him at first he soon notices that he isn't who he appears to be. Instead of ignoring his odd behaviour Levi decides to start investigating and finds that the mystery of Eren Jaeger is more complex than he had initially thought."

"""Kid, the next time I say, ""Let's go someplace like Bolivia,"" let's go someplace like Bolivia."" - Paul Newman (Butch), Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid Jean Kirschtein was born from the dust, a Pennsylvanian boy without a penny to his name and a wandering spirit. Having long idolised the outlaws who galloped through his dimestore novels, he chooses to seek out adventure and fortune out West. Little does he know that he is setting in motion the events that will make him become one of the most renowned and infamous bandits of the century; a member of the legendary Wild Bunch, led by a man who leads Jean to question his beliefs, his morals and his heart. But the days of the West are coming to a close; can he and Marco Bodt, a man famous for being one of the most successful bank robbers of the territory without ever firing a gun, shake loose the Pinkertons, the posses, and the ever-present threat of a modern age that wants them banished to the history books?

"‚Äîliving, that is. EDIT: 9/29/19 This summary is long due for a redo- so here it is! I'm not going to go on for ages this time, just say that I'm writing an extremely non-canon fic about saving the titan trio and helping them heal. It's a mix of fluff, angst, and platonic love, and I've been told by many commenters that it's an emotional ride. Updates are slow because of life issues, I'm a tired person, etc, etc, etc. I have no intention of giving up on the fic, though, so expect it to continue whenever I have the time. To quote from my old summary; ""Canon was not nice to these kids, and I'm going to do them better."" Disclaimer: I'm not all that familiar with canon, and I don't particularly care to be. Thus, this fic is HIGHLY headcanon-based."
"My very existence bends the definition of truth. My whole life I was taught the courage of stars but never really learned. For me my brokenness was a form of art.  I have endured countless battles but yet the war extends. I could never grasp the art of living so why not thrive in the art of dying, its easier that way."
"The date is June 17, 2017. Eren Jaeger is just a normal high school student with no life. In fact, it had become kind of boring. Eren didn't do much other than go to school and play video games with his best friend Armin. Little does he know that his whole world is going to change right in front of his eyes. A couple days after summer starts, Eren sees an unusual shaped object fall from the sky. When he goes to investigate, he finds it to be a strange metallic sphere. On closer inspection, it reveals itself to be a ship, and on the inside is a beautiful creature unknown to Eren. Eren now has two choices. Will he give him to the authorities that continue to bother him at his door? Or Will he protect the strange creature from the humans who wish him harm? When everything goes down Eren will find himself strangely attached to him. This creature is so far from home, and Eren knows he will eventually wish to return. What if he can't let him go?"
"A life of bloodshed - a dirty fight for survival - seeming inevitable to the youth, a future he had been pushed into out of love; or so he had been told. That love, the promise of approval, any resemblance of worth strung him along, to follow what that man had laid out for him. It was a promise that didn't hold out, not as he hid in the back of worn wooden closet, clutching his knees as he picked up on every word of what went on downstairs. The all too sickening cracks of bone and soft pitter patter of blood filtered throughout the home, he heard the hushed whispers as they dragged his father from his home. It was easy for Eren to hide the physical quirks, to conceal a nature he feared, detested; yet to live without the structure he had previously found himself confined in proved to be the most challenging. It was uncontrollable, a nature he was unable to push down, a thing he struggled to cover. The sun would meet the moon, he'd find himself butting heads with a man he could never hope to understand, a man he couldn't burn. Or the weird, mildly dystopian supernatural-esque, and angsty au nobody asked for, but is a fucking blast to write."

"After failing his exams, arguing with teachers and getting in fights for what he's told was the last time, Eren finds out that he's being moved schools -- but not just to any old school. He's being forced to go to Sina Boarding School. And once the initial anger passes, the quiet bitterness sets in. He doesn't want to talk to anyone, or make any new friends, or join any club activities, or hand in his homework on time. And the fucking last thing he wants to do is talk about how he's feeling. Especially not with the annoying teaching guiding him around, the old-timey headmaster whose room smells of coffee, the irritating meatheads in his English class or his weirdly-hot-in-an-emo-way new roommate... (i.e. - the fic in which Eren and Levi end up as unlikely roommates in boarding school and shit happens.)"
"I wake up in the dark. All I hear is beeping. The darkness is pressing down on me, it feels wrong, so wrong. The beeping speeds up. I can't see. Why can't I see? Panic rises in my chest, thrashing against my ribs. The sound of my breath tearing out of me fills my ears. Someone calls my name. * When Marco feels like he has lost himself and his humanity, all he has left is Jean."

"Levi is a petite raven-haired high school student, unfortunately, he not only gets abused at home but at school as well, the group of jocks that bully Levi are led by none other than the school heartthrob Eren Jaeger. Levi is openly gay which one of the many reasons he gets abused, but as they graduate high school and Levi leaves his abusive family to move to a small dorm room with his ex-bully Eren, the tall brunette has matured over the long summer and somehow not remembering the raven, he then gets flashbacks to his high school self-bullying the shorter male and instantly regrets and tries to smooth things over. Will Levi forgive Eren for the years of torture and embrace his feelings or will he forever push him away?"

"Fifteen years after humanity seems to have won the war against the titans, Armin takes a walk and finds it's not nearly as peaceful as he would like it to be because every little thing reminds him of his friends."
"""Ne, Levi, we used to be like that."" Hanji lets out a light laugh, clearly trying to lighten the mood as she brings her mug to her lips, eyes shining with a certain glint behind her glasses. Levi makes a quiet noise of agreement in the back of his throat as he watches the pair dance around each other. He doesn't look away from the window, doesn't look away from the couple, doesn't look away from Eren. Even though he agreed, he didn't believe so. He and Hanji were never like that, not at all. Eren and Jean were two completely different people with a completely different relationship. They bickered playfully, threw around simple insults that meant nothing to the other because they knew how they felt. He and Hanji were polar opposites, one of them a crazed, overly optimistic maniac and the other a rude, stoic and stone cold soldier.  Hanji and him had never been very affectionate towards each other in their relationship. Levi kept it hidden, pushing Hanji away even though they were a couple. They were nothing like Eren and Jean. They'd never been through young love like that."
"They were hungry. They were starving. They had to survive another year until they could sign up for the Training Corps. ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, a little of this. Little of that. Depends on you how much food ya want. More you give, more ya get. Get it? Simple.‚Äù Simple. Eren didn't need to tell Mikasa or Armin how he returned with so much food. Simple. Nobody else needed to know what went on in the darker alleyways of that town. Simple, right? Until he sees some familiar faces passing him in the halls of the Survey Corps. Until Captain Levi senses something not quite right with Eren Jaeger. Until simple becomes more complicated than ever before."
"I grimace as I wipe the blood off my knife with the underside of my boot. ""Fucking bullshit-"" I mutter under my breath as I turn to leave the shop, but a quiet sound stops me in my tracks, a weak sob coming out from behind the counter. I take my gun out and slowly make my way around the aisles to the back of the room. I‚Äôm quiet, careful not to startle who, or whatever, is hidden away. Then I cringe, stepping on a discarded CD case, looking down to see Phil Collins' face split into a hundred little pieces. Bollocks. What kind of bullshit rookie move was that, Levi? The quiet sobs stop sharply and I decide to just rip off the proverbial band aid, stepping swiftly around the counter and pointing my gun at‚Ä¶a kid? What the hell? Mikasa and her younger brother, Eren, are saved by a small group of survivors from becoming another addition to the walking dead. The two are taken back to a growing refugee camp outside the city's limits and need to learn to become part of a new community. Eren, taking no time at all to win the people over with his beaming smile, leaves Mikasa struggling to connect with anybody, and feeling alone in this new gruelling world she finds company in the most unlikely of individuals."

"It's been some time since their funeral, but as spring rolls around Levi is drawn back to their eternal resting places.

"Annie has been freed from her crystal and now must pay the price for her actions. Seeking to keep the power of the Female Titan out of the hands of her enemies, Mikasa must take the power for herself. She has no doubt in her mind that she can do it, but what will she do when Annie has one final request?"
"Out of nowhere, Annie dumped Mikasa and moved away the summer before senior year. No one could get in touch with her, and the two girls spent the next four years missing each other. When they do see each other again, Mikasa only has one question: Why? -- Inspired by Panic! at the Disco's Lying Is The Most Fun A Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off and Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met)."
"A car was waiting for her at the entrance of the building, and she stared at it for a moment before she observed her surroundings. People walked over the streets, going to unknown places, just like her. The traffic noise was annoying and as alive as the people creating it, and some pigeons were flying in the blue sky, making the combination odd through her eyes. Mikasa didn‚Äôt understand why, but when she closed her eyes, she could feel her life was always a lie. ‚ÄúMs. Ackerman?‚Äù Said her driver, coming to take her to the car. She felt in pieces. Still, she smiled like always."

Until he meets his eccentric neighbor, Pieck... If there's one thing he learns from their relationship, it's that life is chock-full of the unexpected."
"The union of a fallen angel and a human was taboo of the worst kind. And so from the moment of Eren‚Äôs birth, Heaven and Hell‚Äôs creatures had set their sights on him. Because sleeping within him is the power of the Nephilim, evil giants who in the past, threw the world into chaos. If this power is allowed to awaken, Eren will have the ability to unite and command others of his kind, wreaking havoc not only against earth and humanity, but also against Heaven. And Hell would like nothing more than to join the fight against God and his angelic creatures. Enter Armin Arlert. One of Heaven‚Äôs loyal soldiers who has been tasked to keep watch over Eren, with explicit orders to strike the youth down if at the first sign of that evil power manifesting itself. Will Armin be able to keep his God given mission, and prevent the realms from falling into catastrophe?

"I was listening to Christina Perri's A Thousand Years (which I have recently discovered was from Twilight, lol, I never realized) and I just felt that this could work with Eren and Levi. Or just anyone and Eren, really. But I'm a fan. So, it was Levi. <3 Anyway... on to the summary: Eren saw it all. The death of the last titan and the destruction of the wall, the freedom of humanity. He also saw the death of humanity's strongest and the discrimination against the remaining titan-shifters. One thousand years finds him with no more will to live, but no desire to die. And then he meets Levi Asselin... and he's so similar to the Levi that he watched die before he could tell him all the things he needed to."

"Three months ago, Eren was in a life altering car accident. Out of the precinct for three months left him a bit out of touch with the detective scene, and the new undead additions to his line of sight have left him a little out of touch with life. He could have lost an arm, left paralysed from the waist down or reduced to a vegetable in the hospital, but no...he can just see Casper in his fucking kitchen. After a few weeks to adjust to his new 'sight' Eren starts to think he won't be able to handle this - the death, the sorrow, the loss. He doesn't think he can cope with it alone. That is, until he meets one ghost, a short, grumpy ghost with the kind of detective mind Eren would kill for, and a hankering for some cigarettes. Apparently the dead can't smoke though, so, huh, who knew?"
"Erwin Smith, boss of Titan Taxi's picks up an enigmatic, and rather moody passenger - Levi Ackerman. He's quickly smitten - but Levi is newly single, confused, and not exactly ready to enter a new relationship. Cue angst. Levi uses Erwin for causal sex, and teases him whenever the opportunity arises, but Erwin needs more. Erwin proceeds to be driven to distraction by Levi's verocious sexual appetite, and then he finally snaps, and exerts his dominance over Levi. Erwin is left broken, feeling utterly shameful.  Levi is left confused, and looks in all the wrong places for the resolution he so sorely needs. The spark of attraction between the two men doesn't ever look like it'll be rekindled, until good friends start to intervene."

"A thousand years ago, a single person developed an ability to wield magical powers. Now, roughly 10% of the country's population is made up of mages.

"This was not the Erwin with polite smiles and unfulfilled duties. This was a man seeking for something he couldn't have for his life. While Levi gazed at him, he recognized the same emptiness he had seen in his own eyes. The same loneliness in his soul. ‚ÄîErwin has wife and kids. Levi doesn't want a boyfriend. Starting with a one-night stand, it was supposed to be simple and detached, but things never stay the way they wanted. Leading a double life is hard, especially when you're trying to fool yourself.

Orphaned and transformed at a young age, you know exactly how hellish the world can be. You tell yourself no one knows how awful fate can be, whether it be a person of your kind, or an outsider of your land. But, is it really true?

I thought that there was always one person you could depend on no matter what to be there for you.  Someone who still cared for you despite all your flaws.  Someone who could see the best and the worst of you and still think you were the greatest person in the entire world. If that was love, then something in my life must've gone horribly wrong."

"Hanji Zo√´. I always was the one who nobody wanted to spend time with, unless it was to hurt me physically or mentally. I got hurt in ways I never expected to get hurt, people who I never thought would betray me, did so. My trust in others shattered like thousands pieces of glass and building it up again was practically impossible. They broke me, hurt me, beat me and laughed about it. None of them showed any signs of regret and they kept going further. They got bigger while I shrunk smaller and smaller. I had nothing to hold onto, nothing that gave me strength, I was on the ground until I got picked up and got taken care of by the only one who would‚Äôve ever taken time to fix me, and I slowly started to believe that everything would work out eventually. I had to believe it, even if I knew it wasn‚Äôt going to work the way I imagined it would.

"‚ÄúWhere are you, Erwin?‚Äù His voice was gentle, as gentle as Levi‚Äôs voice had ever been, as it was capable of being. Erwin blinked, his eyes studying Levi‚Äôs face, that handsome, boyish face that he had fallen in love with, that he had dreamed of, longed for. There was a look of concern etched on those dark features, haunting those steel gray eyes. Levi shook his head, stood on his toes, to reach up and place a hand on Erwin‚Äôs cheek. ‚ÄúWhere do you go?‚Äù With every step they took towards the truth, towards avenging his father‚Äôs death, Erwin began to feel himself pulled further and further away from those he loved. Mike, Hange, Nanaba, Levi above all. And he was sure no one saw the change in him more than Levi. But his search for the truth had consumed him, eaten him alive. He was a slave to that desire, to that dream. It kept him alive in a way nothing else could. Not even Levi."

"Eren's college life revolved around skipping classes and watching his favorite post-apocalyptic TV show with his best friends. More specifically, his life revolved around his favorite character in that show. When a chance arises to meet the character and his actor too, Eren is pulled into a stunt that flips his life upside down. A stunt that allows Eren to spend way more time with a short, grumpy actor than he ever could've dreamed of. Or basically Levi's an actor. Eren's a fanboy. A chance of a lifetime creates a way for all of Eren's little fanboy dreams to come true."

"The Sun is sinking slowly, the sky painted in different shades of pink and orange... It's beautiful and Eren's chest feels fuller, his heart lighter as he drifts. It wouldn't be all so bad, Eren thinks. If the ocean took him away, never to return. He imagines his lungs filling with the water, breathing the ocean as he does air. It'd probably burn but Eren yearns to be a part of the sea - to forget his troubles, to be unaffected by his past traumas, his mental illnesses. It wouldn't be terrible, not in the slightest."
"Hange's voice is rough when she speaks, throat sore from choking on sobs and mind hazy from the endless torture she‚Äôd witnessed today. ‚ÄúI love you, Levi,‚Äù she whispers, voice ever so soft and fatigued. She never realised how much shouting could damage somebody‚Äôs vocal cords, since she‚Äôd never done much of it in the past, after all."

There were others having dreams about the same fucked up world he had lived in in his past life. But quickly he realized that not everyone he knew from his past was able to remember those times. His whole world breaks apart when he realizes the person who meant so much to him although he had never met him himself has no memories of his tragic past."

"When Eren left, Levi could feel the joy in his heart vanish. His own tears were quick to well up in his own eyes, a mixture of frustration and depression would fill his heart. He didn‚Äôt know how to fix Eren, he simply couldn‚Äôt fix Eren."

Something to tie us down and make sure we don't fly away with the slightest blow of the wind. That will always be Eren for me."" After Armin faces the worst moments of his life, who will be there to comfort him? How will he move on? And, most importantly, how is he supposed to not fall in love with his saviour?"
"Levi thinks back to when he started losing Eren. Will they be able to fix what they have lost after getting Eren back from Marley?"
"Where Jean dreams of a certain boy he used to know, and is able to touch him again, however briefly. And then finally, he's able to send him off, with one new promise to burden. Also, there's Eren at the end, in hopes for recovery, just in case it's sad."
"Eren spills Levi's tea and things heat up in unexpected ways."
"Vampires and wolves have always been sworn enemies. Never to go near each other, until Levi Ackerman, a royal vampire and the air to the thrown of kingdom sina. Falls in love with Eren Jeager, a quiet lone werewolf with a bad past. A forbidden love, never to be spoke of, behind closed doors and always on the run. Levi falls into a world full of lies, running from everything he's ever believed in. Risking death and betrayal, all for the sake of love."
"The sound of the waves crashing against the shore shook him out of his trance. Eren sighed as he repositioned himself on the sand. If this had been another time and place then maybe he would've had the luxury of enjoying the calming murmur; this slow, tranquil background noise. He couldn't differentiate between the sky and the water, he only saw the white of the foam as the wave broke, it was like looking out to an inky black canvas with a moon half covered by clouds being the only source of illumination."
"neuropraxia; definition: temporary failure of nerve conduction in the absence of structural changes, due to blunt injury, compression or ischemia."
"‚ÄúYo, Uri, do you think I‚Äôm a bad person?‚Äù ‚ÄúTo me,‚Äù Uri says, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not, although I suppose you would be to almost everyone else.‚Äù"
"In which humanity‚Äôs strongest soldier‚Äôs end is not particularly violent‚Äîor quick, for that matter. But is doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt brutal, especially for one Eren Jaeger."
"Levi lives a sheltered, lonely life; lacking love and freedom but filled with every material comfort he could seek. Eren lives a similar life, happy and full of freedom, but lacking someone to ground him. Their families, bitter rivals, remained as such for decades... Until the events of one summer. Or... the Romeo and Juliet AU nobody asked for! This just hit me when I was listening to Check Yes, Juliet by We The Kings, but it is NOT a songfic. This story is a modern (very loose) adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, starring Eren and Levi. *****IF YOU DISLIKE OR ARE OFFENDED BY THE EREN X LEVI SHIP FROM ATTACK ON TITAN, PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS WORK. There‚Äôs no explicit content and I will be adapting ages in this AU, but the canon basis still stands.*****"
"No matter how rambunctious, hot headed, and unruly he was, Eren Jaeger was still a doctor's son. And a doctor can save you...or take you apart. (Where we get to see the smarter side of Eren that's always been overshadowed by his anger, and how that changes everything .)"
"Humanity survived and the Titans have been wiped out. All that remains is to help repopulate. The Military has issued out a series of surveys to all factions of which each member must complete in order to ensure maximum compatibility. That is not to say the results will be agreeable, however. (Levimika, Eruhan--Multiple Ships) Rated M for some language and sexual themes. (COMPLETE)"
"A companion to canon. Over the years, what starts out as mutual respect and admiration grows into something far deeper than Eren and Levi imagined it would."
"""I love you. I don't want you to say anything back and I expect that you push me away after this and treat me cold, but I do love you and that won't change. I don't want to be gone without telling you."" This story takes place in episode 3 and up to episode 5 of season 3"
"It couldn't fucking end this way. Not when we finally found happiness in this godforsaken rock. Not when we finally won."
"Eren must learn the harsh realities that go along with being Humanities Last Hope but this lesson comes at a high price."
"It all started with one tall freckled stranger, one oblivious blond and one crushing best friend, is this love triangle destined to be, or is it all just unrequited love? It all started at a beach party.. little did they know it would end up like this. 3 Simple rules, what was so difficult about that?"
"Levi Ackerman has been one of the world's most skilled assassins as long as he can remember. He's also always been alone, and liked it that way. That is, until his boss forced a partner on Levi. Not just any partner, a hot-headed, loud mouthed boy who only cares about himself. Levi is stuck in a vicious cycle of starting his new life with the younger boy, not only learning to work together. But both have to work as a team. And bonding in ways they didn't think was possible."
"Somehow Eren is still the most beautiful, awful thing Levi has ever seen. (Podfic for Unlocked by thisgirlsays22)"
"Levi is determined to fulfill his promise to Erwin."
"Hannes grabbed Mikasa, thinking Eren would follow. Only he didn‚Äôt. He was standing at the titan‚Äôs feet when it grabbed his mother and ate her. That was the last anyone saw of him. Cut to 5 years later, when the colossal titan appears again at Trost, and and everyone is freaking out. Suddenly, this titan appears and starts killing the others. Turns out to be Eren, who has been living for 5 years alone in titan territory."
"Eren was the second son. He was supposed to be free to love and marry whoever he wanted. So why was he being sent to marry some stranger?"
"Written for Eruri week 2018 day 3: Enemies to Lovers. Levi has noticed it for years but doesn‚Äôt say anything about it."
"[Manga Spoilers] After returning from their journey to the Ocean, Jean and Armin are separated. Jean does work for the Garrison and Armin is sent for further training. Feeling a little lonely with their new assignments, they begin writing to each other. However, not everything is peaceful in Paradis. The citizens are reeling from recent revelations that they are not alone in this world, and some begin to wonder if they might have been better off not knowing what was outside the walls . . ."
"‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù it‚Äôs the only thing that comes out of Jean‚Äôs mouth. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he responds sincerely, and he thinks that something must have broken inside of him, because his voice doesn‚Äôt sound like his own. ‚ÄúI just wanted to.‚Äù -------------------------------------------------------------- After an emotional train ride with the people he cares about the most, Eren ponders upon his role in the war and the freedom he has lost.

"Nanaba didn't know what she'd do without Mike once word came that he was missing. She vowed she'd find him once more."
"Eren joins the military and begs to become Captain Levi's assistant, hopefully speeding up the process to joining the Survey Corps, a childhood dream of his. War is a struggle, especially when you‚Äôre in love. It gives you a new reason to live and fight. Eren is in quite a predicament when he falls for the older soldier."
"Details how Bertolt Hoover and Annie Leonhardt's personality changes through the years, the circumstances behind it, and ultimately how it results to the development of their relationship."
"She let out a loud sigh, frustrated at Tamara's insecurity. She almost wanted to force her into her old clothing, just like she used to do for her before she gained her confidence, along with her Erwin. She always helped her out in her time of need, when she felt hurt and insecure, it was time for her to do the same."
"You're a simple android destined for a simple existence. Sitting under the lonely starlight, you dream of faraway galaxies and grand adventures. That is, until you meet the new master of the Ackerman manor. An insufferable, stuck-up man with deep eyes and even deeper scars, he shows you what life has to offer. But can you truly live if you've never been alive?"
"Floch and Armin might be diametrically opposed, but Eren is their coordinate."

"Enemy, apprentice, friend. Associate is too clinical, lover sounds too personal, partner too enduring. Confidante? Comrade? Companion? There is no word for what Levi is, to him. What do you call an equal other than an equal? A counterpart, Erwin thinks. - from ACWNR to fall of Wall Maria"

One day, three of them are offered a chance to be forgiven in exchange for their strength. During their first mission, Isabel and Farlan die, leaving Levi with a choice. Save his last standing friend from the underground to possibly get eaten by a Titan, or leave her to rot and get eaten by the underground city's darkness. For her sake, Levi allows her to see the sky of blue. With time and experience, she reaches Levi's level or skill, and earns the right to share his title of humanity's strongest. ~SLOW UPDATES~"

With time and bone breaking work she reaches Levi's level of skill, and earns the right to share his title of humanity's strongest. They are weapons to be used as their Commander sees fit.

"Everyone is saddened by the loss of Erwin Smith after taking back Wall Maria, but nobody is as sad as Levi and Hange. One night, they find comfort in each other."
"When Hange met Levi, little did she know everything that would come after. Not just titans and the end of the world, but their own personalities, problems, and not to mention those developing feelings none of them want to acknowledge. Over time their relationship changes, for good and worse. But at the end they always come back to each other. It‚Äôs only a matter of time. ‚ÄîAKA the LeviHan journey. From meeting to friends, to something more, to hating each other (or do they?), to rekindling their relationship, etc."
"Eren Fluff, mostly platonic situations with the other characters. Eren being cute with his friends and officers. I also do chapters with the other boys as the focus :) TW*"
"""To understand my feelings for Levi it would be necessary to understand the meaning of life itself, I wished I had never met him because his non-existence hurt me less than knowing that in my memories he was real, but in my stretched hands he was not, I wished that the sponges I rubbed on his skin or my shy kisses on his cheek would be enough to erase the calendars in the corridor, to erase the territorial marks of what ate him claiming him his, and I found myself powerless knowing that he was fading i couldn't stop him.That I never had the power to free him from the chains of those who made us human, because his flowery hands, his ignorant kindness and his warmth were alien to human cruelty."""
"Isn't it funny, how at one moment, life is sparkling and bright like the sun in a blue sky, and then the next it all starts fraying at the seams? And then you look up and the dark sky, you stare at the stars and you ask them, how did this happen? How did everything break in an instant?"
"""Armin knew Jean wouldn‚Äôt fully belong to him the same way he knew he would never fully belong to Jean. Armin knew he‚Äôd been in love with someone else too long to move on completely."" Jean and Armin are in a relationship, but both know in their hearts they'll never love each other as much as they want to."
"The arms of war which hold me dear, have comforted me and strained me since birth. Born into a life dedicated to unjustified killing directed at the devils that live across the open sea. But when you suddenly invade my land, my Oh Holy land, with your damned morals and blood, I shiver at the way your eyes glaze over me. Now I must be damned, for what matters more to me? The values of war that have held me dear, or your arms that are held open in waiting."
"After the war has ended, the loss of brother in the warzone kept haunting Porco's soul. He felt devastated and the only thing he was excited for was seeing Pieck, his fiance, waiting for him in the train station. Little did he know she'll bring him a surprise..."
"Sakura Suzuki is a member of the 104th cadet, having grown up with Armin, Mikasa and Eren in Shinganshina, and living with her father Hannes and her brother Apollo, when the Colossal titan attacked, having to flee put a different sight on the world for Sakura, she joined the cadets with her friends and met three other people she grew to trust 100%, one she fell in love with, join this young lady on her journey of life, with having to deal with the issues of the world, enjoy^^"
"The most important lesson you learned from the Survey Corps was that regret was the root of all lost causes. Life had no in-betweens; it was either you were, or you weren't alive. On the field, it was the same: you did it or you didn't. And you would have to answer for that choice, so the only thing you could do was to make the decision you regretted least. Commander Erwin believed this, so Captain Levi surely did. And now, so did Jean. Or, The aftermath of the Return to Shiganshina, where Jean reflects on the lessons he's learnt under the late commander's tutelage."
"Mikasa talks to Sasha about her feelings; but the girl is not there to listen. Song: Lucy ‚Äî Skillet"
"Mikasa and Eren hit a rough patch, Mikasa seeks comfort in Armin, the comfort becomes more."
"and it's just around the corner, darlin cause it lives in me no, i could never give you peace winter 844"
"Your best friend Eren despises the idea of soulmates and wishes to live a happy life with his girlfriend, who does not match the mark on his neck, paying no mind to the limitations of the universe. After finding out that you have always been his soulmate, you hide the truth from him because you prioritize his happiness. You suppress your romantic feelings as much as possible, all until Eren decides to cut the only hope you had of you getting together one day. And this is when it all starts to collapse."
"Marco breaks up with Jean."
"As unpleasant as being shot was, Sasha isn‚Äôt all too surprised to find that her eyes slowly flutter open some undetermined time later. There‚Äôs still the telltale ache of injury radiating from her navel to her pelvis, back, and chest, but it‚Äôs nothing a seasoned soldier like herself can‚Äôt handle. Her flesh feels solid, her clothes real. She can pinpoint the exact place where the cotton slides around her shoulders and caresses her skin, the collar far too big, but that too has weight on her body. Weight that feels tangible and completely, undoubtedly real. Her shaking fingers press deeply into the junction between the skin of her jaw and her neck. She waits, counting the seconds, to find her heartbeat. She waits, and waits, and waits. There is no pulse."
"Working towards a degree to become a Veterinarian, your professor, Keith Shadis, decided to give his students the option to do 'Secret Santa' for extra credit. Taking the opportunity to receive a better grade, you end up with Levi Ackerman. He's a stranger to you, so you try to find ways to know more about him... but is it for Secret Santa?"
"‚ÄúHey, Levi?‚Äù Erwin said and rapped on the door. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù Asked Levi over the sound of the shower. ‚ÄúYou know that pan you made the pizza in last night?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, what about it?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, I noticed you didn‚Äôt wash it with the other dishes last night, which is fine, you do a lot of work, but I tried to wash it this morning and I can‚Äôt get that black stuff off. I scrubbed it with soap and hot water for like a half hour and it won‚Äôt get clean.‚Äù There was a pause for a moment and all Erwin could hear was the shower running. Then Levi spoke. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You used soap on my cast iron skillet?‚Äù"
"Levi is the Corps' omega; it is his duty to warm the beds of soldiers, at the pleasure of the Commander, Erwin Smith. Wall Maria has fallen. Erwin leads a force into titan-territory to help find survivors, grain, and gold; his life is increasingly without pleasure, save for the omega Levi who keeps him company on dark nights. Meanwhile, in the walls, the Interior voices concern over the loss of it's omega population, and the nobility seeks to ensure omegas remain in their control."
"Captain Levi wishes to spend the last day before the 57th Expedition Outside the Walls in good company ‚Äî with no other than that recruit from the 104th who he struggles to keep out of his head. *Female reader insert, but for the sake of this fanfic, we‚Äôll call you Satoru ^^ *Part 2 of a series, but it can be read on its own (there‚Äôs a few references to Part 1, but that‚Äôs it). *NO SPOILER"

"Two individuals that think love is pointless until it happens to them. Now they deal with the new phenomenon that is first loves, first kisses, and first times."
"""What the hell do you think you're doing!"" Levi said, disappointment and annoyance clear in his tone. He stood in the open door way, eyebrows furrowed as he took in the scene before him.

"""Armin Arlert."" Historia declares and it takes all his willpower not to flinch. ""You have been chosen to serve the people of Paradise as the new commander of the Scouting legion, more known as the Survey Corps."" Armin gently closes his eyes, ignoring the death glares his so called yeagerist 'comrades' were giving him. ""Do you swear to keep Paradise's best interest at heart?"" His throat is dry enough to bleed. Armin forces the words out anyway. ""I swear."" Or Armin officially becomes the 15th commander of the Scouts.

Maybe he would mind his own business if he actually felt that Armin deserved you, and maybe he wouldn't see your face whenever his eyes shut if you hadn't engraved it so deeply into his mind. It's unfair and instantaneous. He never even asked to fall for you, and yet he can't seem to see an end as he drifts. For once, Eren has set his eyes on something he actually craves, and he won‚Äôt rest until he can call it his own.

"You couldn't shake the way he looked at you. He looked at you as if you were a ghost, someone-- no, something-- sent to haunt him. It was ironic, really, that he should look at you as if you were someone long dead when you felt most alive when you were with him. So whenever his gaze met yours, you held it for as long as you dared, longing to be with him in even this insignificant way. You had a tentative friendship, but somehow being a phantom to him felt infinitely more personal. *** You had no memory of anything before you woke up in a refugee camp days after the fall of Wall Maria. Two years passed since the breach, and after going to bed hungry more often than not, you decided to join the 104th training corps so that you wouldn't starve to death. It was this series of events that led to you meeting Bertholdt Hoover. Later, you would realize how inevitable falling in love with him had been after that fateful moment when you entered the wrong barracks. And once you had began to pull on the thread that loving him had created, everything slowly unraveled. This is a rewrite of my unfinished fanfic, ‚ÄòA Girl Named Noah‚Äô. Updates frequently, no longer on a set schedule."

"He saw through her, and that was more than enough for her. And so, inspite of herself, she fell in love with him. But she was just someone he wants to love. Not someone he really can. Or so he thought. Or so she thought. (P.S. Ya'll might be dissuaded by the length of this.)"

He had the perfect life with the perfect friends until his addiction to meth threatens to destroy him. The reader unexpectedly forms a really deep bond with him and tries to help him survive the addiction. But the path to sobriety was easier to be said than done."
"Death is the one thing guaranteed in life. No matter how we live, it's the one thing we are all granted at the end. Death is as much a part of life as breathing and speaking, yet no matter how much we like to believe otherwise, we are never prepared for it. And when it comes it leaves a wake of pain in all it touches but does not take. We cannot stop it, not by force, not by praying it away. We can only continue moving forward and endure. And you may call Isa Vires a fool for thinking the way forward for humanity is with the Scouts, and perhaps she is, but her fantasies of a world without titans and memories of death are enough to keep her going. However, with the Scouts, Isa soon finds the world holds far more than just death and freedom and Isa wishes to experience it all."

You returned to your peaceful and uneventful life, away from the hustle of the Survey Squad. Away from the friends and comrades you once had, away from Levi, the man who loved and broke you. You were a good soldier, they say. You can rest now, they say. You haven't made History, you're not dead either, but something inside you is. So when the Survey Squad returns from their successful mission, you don't interfere. You don't visit your former friends. You remain silent. Erwin notice, and he doesn't like that. Because he's not losing one more good soldier for a broken heart, despite what you or Levi think of it."

"For the past two years, Sasha's been gathering up the courage to confess to her long time bestfriend, Jean Kirstein. She felt like it was the perfect time to make the long waited announcement. Turns out Sha isn't the only one who has a confession to make."
"Eren has been frightened of Levi for a while now, and has no idea why. When Eren is wandering around the castle one night he bumps into Levi in the kitchen and they have a little conversation concerning Eren's fears."
"[FULL SNK SPOILERS] He loves them. He can't pinpoint exactly when it happened, but Levi had long since caught feelings and was in far too deep to get discouraged or truly disgusted by them. Hange was dirty, annoying, gross and insane in every way. Yet, he loves them. It still took him until the last day of their life before he even got close to confessing. When he calls out that stupid nickname he deemed them almost eleven years ago, the look they give is enough for him to know that he has missed his chance. He loves them, still."
"‚ÄúWait!‚Äù Armin cries, pulling Eren to a halt. Eren stares back at him with that same intense gaze that almost makes Armin want to cower. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Eren asks. ‚ÄúOh, I...I just was wondering if‚Äî‚Äù he takes a deep breath. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù ‚ÄúAre we...can we be friends?‚Äù Eren rolls his eyes, and Armin‚Äôs hope momentarily shatters. ‚ÄúDuh,‚Äù Eren laughs‚Äîlaughs!‚Äîand Armin doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs ever heard such a wonderful sound. ‚ÄúNow quit staring all bug-eyed and let‚Äôs go, or we‚Äôll be late for dinner!‚Äù And so begins the friendship that will shatter the world."
"Eren is and will always be a fighter. Willing to put everything at risk for his own selfish wants and needs. He does things simply because he can and has the power too, regardless if the reason is understandable. He can‚Äôt escape his detrimental nature,  even if he tried, he doesn‚Äôt want too. The main goal being to create as much destruction as humanly possible. Drowning himself completely in his desire to live freely, to be bound by nothing. Until he met you. Eren being entirely succumbed by his emotions, willing to go through with desperate measures to have you. Once he makes up in his mind that he wants something, it is forever set in stone. Doing everything in his capability to have it, to claim and mark it as his own. That something just happens to be you."

"""Promise me, Levi. Promise me you'll find her no matter what! The letter, It's all wrong!"" Apollo begged, eyes bleeding and mouth dripping with blood. It was a different fear Levi saw in his eyes while Apollo was being eaten alive. Not fear from the titans, but fear from a much larger thing. ‚Äî Apollo, a veteran in the Survey Corps, his strength is as strong as the whole military brigade but very down-to-earth. His sudden death deeply affected not only his friends but the force of the whole regimen. Hange had acted strangely after his death. She and Apollo grew up in the same village and they already expected that she was the one who would be deeply affected. It was what Levi thought too until she showed a familiar book to them and revealed the last letter of their friend. Apollo wants to recruit her sister in the scouts and it was obvious that Hange doesn't agree with it. I mean, Apollo said she might be aggressive and rude but that's all. Why would Hange be scared and hate her? The two of them had always been a mystery. Levi, Erwin, Miche are too clueless about the current situation to even intervene. Should they put their trust in this woman?"
"I see how the titans cry And how they feel their pain But you insist to slay their breed And I would do the same. I see how the titans cry Because it was almost you The you who would the trampling us But now you lay as dust."

"Close, yet platonic. You‚Äôre almost content with having your relationship with her remain like this. Almost. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî In which Y/N tries to suppress her growing affections for her best friend, Yelena."
"This is more of a filler of the attack on titan storyline,it won't interfere with the main plot but I will add tweaks to make it fit the standards of the readers I want to reach. It's set at the start when they are about to go to Shiganshina,from then on and up it'll be pieces here and there with a storyline that fits even after post manga. This is my favourite ship so I will try my hardest not to butcher it where the jearmin soul lives on."
"SPOILERS FOR THE MANGA ENDING Armin landed on the ground, he was laying still and stared up at the sky, he couldn‚Äôt really see through all the steam. His eyes hurt. Eren was dead. And his last words to him were ‚ÄòI really love Mikasa‚Äô? He shouldn‚Äôt be upset about that. Eren had the right to love her. Armin should be glad the rumbling had stopped and that he wouldn‚Äôt have to die in some years due to the titan curse. But he just couldn‚Äôt. He couldn‚Äôt stop his heart to fall apart. ‚ÄûIt‚Äôs not over?...-‚Äú"
"A new virus has spread through the underground cities of the capital. 95% of the people who catch the virus would normally die. When infected your vocal cords will physically not work in any way. It has been just as if you were mute. If you did survive you can talk, but your voice would be the week. Barely able to speak or anything. So when Michi gets infected right as he‚Äôs about to go into the training corpus and is left to suffer on his own. Fast forward a few years and everything has turned for the worst. All of his friends dead. He never speaks to others unless needed. His voice grows weaker and weaker. Though being in the shadows for 4 years he finally is given more public recognition from others. At least not in the best way. ‚ÄúWhen will this hell end.‚Äù A/n: This will not have any events of the new part of season 4 I haven't caught up with it yet and please no spoilers."

"Eren goes on, flattening the world on which he stands. Only memories are there to keep him company. OR Eren remissness about his past and what could have been. He also has conversations with Jean, Connie, Levi, Annie, and Reiner."
"Freedom has never existed in the form that people imagine it to be. The idea that we make every decision ourselves is ridiculous. Fate will always be there, whether we believe in it or not. But sometimes we make a decision. A decision so unpredictable, so atypical, that it has a lasting impact on the fate of our world. That's what happened to Cassandra Winters... and the one who came before her."
"While the relationship between Levi and Erwin has slowly started to disintegrate over the years, the arrival of the latest hope for humanity in the shape of Titan-turning Eren Jeager puts everything even further on the spot when it turns out that Eren is harbouring some deeper feelings for Levi. Jealousy and possessiveness forces Erwin to realise that he needs to act if he wants to prevent Levi from falling for Eren's allure, but the questions he has to face is - what does Levi actually want and what will he do if it's already too late...."

However, when a special until shows up to take over the case, things take a different turn, and Levi is forced to work with a member of the new unit, an alpha and a werewolf to boot, two of the things he despises the most."
"Annie, while not much for conversation, has become a trusted listener for all of my inner thoughts and constant ramblings. Sometimes I swear I almost see her smirk when I‚Äôm particularly frustrated. Something about the darkness of the basement, and silence of my listener makes me more bold, more honest about myself and my thoughts about what has happened since the breach of wall Maria. I smile to myself, ‚ÄúI think Sasha has a crush on the new guy. You should see the way the two of them act around each other.

"Heavy footsteps stormed close, heels clicking with each violent step. Eren whipped around the corner in a flurry of pastels.

It appeared he had a type: tall, blonde, book smart, and Zeke checked all the boxes despite being an annoying piece of shit. But picking a dare had been a mistake, as a mischievous grin appeared on Zeke‚Äôs face. Levi suddenly felt a little nervous, as Zeke was moving closer to him on the couch.

They‚Äôre still watching; they‚Äôre always watching; they‚Äôre watching him at the precipice of something that could destroy him if he let it, if he doesn‚Äôt take a step away from the edge of the rooftop.

"After a battle beyond the walls, a captain paid his respect to the fallen soldiers."
"Annie and Armin are walking silently towards a green, fresh hill. Armin looks at his bride like she‚Äôs the only person who matters. He looks at her like she‚Äôs the only human, breathing, living creature he could ever be capable to love. His eyes swell and wedge, lushed together. They‚Äôre like icy, oceanic buds blossoming to reveal a whole new definition of what 'love' is. Until they reach Eren‚Äôs grave. Annie realizes that Armin is capable of loving another deceased, bashful, shameful human more than her. She looks at her groom. His face is rested. The waves gushing in shade‚Äôs are stopped, dead in their tracks. His lips are no longer smiling brightly. He‚Äôs frowning. Armin‚Äôs voice is gentle when he talks to Eren‚ÄîEren‚Äôs grave. ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù he says. So sincerely. So peacefully. In a manner he had never talked to Annie before. That‚Äôs when she realized she will never replace Eren. Hell, she won‚Äôt even come near to the status Eren once was to Armin. Annie and Armin form a family after Eren‚Äôs defeat. It‚Äôs more complicated than any of them could‚Äôve expected‚Äîand it certainly isn‚Äôt perfect."
"Mikasa wondered if it‚Äôs soaked into the way she spoke to him too. He said something or another and while she couldn‚Äôt remember what the conversation was even about, couldn‚Äôt remember what she said back to his probably innocent and non-arousing statement, her tone was by no means docile. The shock and surprise were written clearly on his face. Slaves weren‚Äôt supposed to speak to their masters that way, were they? Or Even after all the awful things Eren's done, the hurtful things he said at that table, Mikasa still somehow convinces him to take her hand and run."
"""What about Mikasa?"" ""What about her?"""
"Jean is a successful and wealthy lawyer living in a beautiful penthouse apartment in a major city. His life of luxury and success would be almost perfect if not for his persistent loneliness.

Jean and Armin reconnect, and Jean soon realizes that Armin‚Äôs life has not been kind to him as he begins to develop feelings for the troubled blond who is struggling to survive."
"old habits came hand in hand with old faces - you and eren knew that all too well."
"‚ÄúHe‚Äôs asking to speak with you,‚Äù Came the unusually steady and thick voice from Mikasa. He‚Äôd wondered if she‚Äôd been crying. Levi raised his head and met eyes with the impossibly dark embers of the girl, who‚Äôd bulked impossibly over the past few years. The stress of Eren‚Äôs absence had worn her, causing a slight wrinkle around her eyebrows. Her eyes were always dark and aged with experience, though. ‚ÄúMe?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Mikasa replied, a bit harsher. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt keep him waiting.‚Äù She turned and briskly walked towards the back, where they kept Eren locked and chained upon his arrest. Eren. - Eren and Levi are reunited on the airship."
"‚ÄúWhat will you do when this is over?‚Äù Levi asks, absentmindedly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to retire quietly, in the countryside. Perhaps I could write a book.‚Äù"

"''So who can blame Armin for indulging in old memories, even if many bring back the burning flames of his past? He tells himself that being selfish never got Commander Erwin anywhere, and he goes to bed surrounded by his friends who he's stuck by and survived with for what seems like an eternity. The emotion he feels can't quite be described so simply as ‚Äòhappy‚Äô, but perhaps satisfaction. Perhaps a sense of family, kinship within these people he's grown up around and in turn seen grow up. So he takes it with a stick of levity and drifts off to sleep, nestled between Mikasa and Eren like they used to as children, crowded in the same bunk fighting giggles. He likes to think he'll dream of the sea, the crashing waves filling his eyes until peace swallows him whole. '' Armin Arlert has more nightmares than he would like to admit."

"And as she slept, he had realised that this - Mikasa‚Äôs suffering - was his own personal torture, as if someone had purposely hurt her just to torment and agonise him. It was a living nightmare."
"They say that love is stronger than death, but life has proved it wrong so many times. Still, is it wrong to have a miracle happen just once?"
"Armin feels his face twist into a snarl briefly, but when he looks at Eren, his eyes catch on his and Mikasa‚Äôs tangled hands. Hers are squirming under his grip, and then pull against her stomach in a gesture that makes Armin dizzy for a moment. He sees again that line of red, but‚Äîit‚Äôs not blood. When he sees what it actually is, he almost wishes it was. ‚Äú‚ÄòM fine,‚Äù Mikasa says. Her breath is coming too fast, too shallow. ‚ÄúJust‚Äîcold‚Ä¶‚Äù Eren‚Äôs eyes shine with wonder, locked on their joint hands and what‚Äôs below them; the red spilling out from the gaps in her buttons. That is not right, Armin thinks, gut churning. That shouldn‚Äôt be happening. But at the same time, isn‚Äôt that just the same old story? *** Eren lives, and what comes after."
"‚ÄúJean is fine, Eren. I‚Äôm sure he is,‚Äù Armin sounds far away and Eren almost snaps at him, but he can‚Äôt find a voice to do so. Instead he swallows thickly and takes a shaky breath, covering his mouth with a trembling hand to prevent a sob from escaping."
"My mother once told me that if I left the farm, a horrible monster would catch me right away, before the scorching sun could kiss my skin red, or the lack of moisture on my tongue could wilt me away. Though, one day I did leave the farm. And I did it again and again.. until the thought of these beasts was just a mere whisper at the back of my brain. I went out to visit a man, one who caught my curiosity from the start."
"Sometimes the loneliness gets too much"
"""You can't do it, Historia,"" he says. He's right. She can't."
"When your gaze locked with his you could feel every bit of trauma, pain, and death behind his dark eyes. You found yourself not being able to look away, staring into his face with a shocked mien. In those few minutes of simply watching him, you knew him. You knew his every fear and his every desire. But he could also see yours. He could see how much you've been through, on purpose and on accident.. He saw everything even you didn't see. He saw the pain a mother during his era must go through.."
"NOTE: ALL CHARACTERS ARE ADULTS AND NO AGE GAPS EXCEED 3 YEARS Even though Erwin isn't dead, in many ways it still feels like he is. Levi finds himself falling apart after the reclamation of Wall Maria."
"‚ÄúI hate you.‚Äù The words felt wrong yet so right on his tongue, Eren‚Äôs heart was pounding in his chest. ‚ÄúI will kill every single one of you. Be damned if I die while trying to.‚Äù An amused scoffed answered him before large hands firmly grabbed his hips, bringing their bodies closer. ‚ÄúOh? Is that what you want, little hunter?"" Levi‚Äôs cold nose never left his neck as he breathed out the words, not sounding worried in the slightest. A shiver ran down Eren's spine. ""To stab me with your wooden stake?‚Äù"
"Four years should seem like enough time, at least that's what the two of your had told yourselves, but that's not always the case. Reiner was strong but even the strong are sometimes weak, and sometimes the strong can't seem to escape the nightmares that plague them. He was getting better, he was finally working through and finding ways to keep himself in check since coming back from war with Eldia but one small mistake sends him running to a place where he knows will ease his mind and allow him to finally push those memories back to the darkness from whence they came. The hill that overlooks the ocean, the hill where he fell in love with you and the hill that he knew you would be able to find him at."

"""I kept my promise. Now it‚Äôs your turn. Come back to me.‚Äù As the Beast Titan decimates the Survey Corps at the battle of Shiganshina, everything seems lost.

"That bespectacled girl has once approached him, and he decided to push her away. She did nothing but only hoping to become good friends with him, and he was hoping totally the opposite. ""Go away."" Was always his final say and he left her there pondering. She knew how much impossible for a muted girl like her to get the attention of the hottest man in their Junior High, still. . . Hange Zoe has no reason to give up yet. So she ended up just watching him, from afar. And continued with that habit until both of them achieved their own successful carrier.

"A twitch of the little girl‚Äôs finger, and the sound of an explosion and a bullet piercing flesh slammed into everyone‚Äôs ears. A spray of blood shot out behind him. A single exhale, a slight gasp of surprise. The sound of a thud as a body hit the ground. The girl looked shocked, which seemed odd. Hadn‚Äôt she known what would have happened if she‚Äôd pulled the trigger? Conny turned around. Maybe she‚Äôd hit one of the others. His eyes widened and his breath turned to stone in his lungs."

"""And so, when Eren and Mikasa‚Äôs gazes meet, and they go outside ‚Äîand Jean follows, pulled out by something invisible, electricity moving his feet‚Äî, and Eren puts a hand on her hair and says ‚ÄúYou should cut it‚Äù, Jean Kirstein understands.

"In which Eren is the teenage shifter who has a shitty home life, anger issues and a society that actually hates him (not in that order) and Levi is the older, badass cool kid with a penchant for smoking and not taking in strays. Unfortunately Eren happens to be the exception, when they meet one winter morning outside Trost High and Levi discovers to his dismay that he does have a heart... But in a world where shifters are discriminated against and people from Levi's background are only ever going to go down, it's unlikely that either are going to make it very far. Really, it's just a matter of time."
"‚ÄúPromise me you‚Äôll come home.‚Äù ‚ÄúI promise.‚Äù ‚ÄúPinkies?‚Äù A chuckle leaves Reiner‚Äôs lips as he wraps his pinky finger gently around yours. ‚ÄúPinkies.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou better come back, Braun. I mean it.‚Äù You try to give him your toughest glare, but it just makes him laugh harder. He squeezes your pinky finger a little harder and smiles at you one more time before boarding the ship bound for Paradis. Your Reiner is leaving. He‚Äôll be back. He has to come back. You knew that he would be fine, but the anxiety in your heart won‚Äôt settle."
"Levi could see this was going to be one hell of a language barrier between them as he lifted his hands up in what he presume was a non-threatening gesture. The action only made the creature quickly get on all four his ears pointed forward his tail up and swinging side to side in complete aggression. ‚ÄúIt's alright, you're hurt.‚Äù Levi wasn't big on talking or it was more like he couldn't express himself very well with words alone. The kid had the most gorgeous voice his ears has ever had the pleasure of hearing...it was soft low, but crystal clear with a strong rolling accent of words he couldn't understand. ‚ÄúMy name is Levi.‚Äù Levi spoke to him thinking an introduction was the right thing to do at the time."
"Guns are made for final decisions, not second guesses. You pull the trigger, there are no regrets. There's always something on the other end, receiving the bullet. You can either look firmly ahead as you take another man's life, or bite the dust. Only the trigger has the answer. Levi Ackerman learned this while he was on the run after murdering his best friend and wife for having an affair behind his back. Traveling through towns, meeting countless people who always had a story to tell over a glass of whiskey and a smoke, and that one shitty brat he met in some shitty town who just couldn't leave him the hell alone."
"All that could be heard was their moans and grunts as well as the sound of skin slapping against skin which were becoming louder. He had his legs wrapped around Eren's waist urging him to go deeper. Both of them were lost in the feeling of utter bliss. Nothing else mattered."
"Eren hates vampires with a passion. They nearly killed someone extremely close to him and he's not going to forgive them for it. One day during one of his midnight strolls, he meets a stranger. This stranger could prove to be more dangerous than he'd like to have thought. The stranger's name is Jean Kirschtein, a vampire who instantly pisses Eren off. Eren wants nothing to do with this guy. But much to his dismay, Jean is going to take everything that Eren's always stood for and throw it in the trash."
"Levi is content with silence, content with the sound of rain. The same sound that drowns out every silent cry, every dry tear, every unspoken word at the tip of his tongue. The pain is unbearable, but he doesn't let emotion slip through that mask of indifference he's kept up for all these years. His face still remains devoid of any emotion other than detachment. Yet, he wants to feel. Wants every cut to hurt more than just bleed. He wants to tear away at his flesh until there is nothing left of it. Pain seems to be the only way to relieve the guilt eroding his mind. But now, Levi is far gone. Lost in his own darkness. Can a certain bright-eyed brat help Levi find his way back into the light?"

In the midst of the mayhem of dealing with his parents and trying to get somewhat closer Petra, he finds himself falling further and further in love with the young boy, who is named Eren.

"Levi had had a difficult childhood, he had seen his companions die devoured by titans and could no longer find a reason to continue living. Erwin selfishly proposed to be the motivation to keep fighting. When he said ""Give your hearts"" to the soldiers he asked them for a sacrifice. But when he said ""Give your heart to me"" to Levi, it had a completely different meaning. Erwin and Levi, in difficult moments, they always found comfort in each other, and not only that.

"They would have taken him eventually. The ultimatum they had given Erwin had spoken volumes. They might have needed the Legion to continue exploring the outside world and eradicating any Titans that might have remained beyond the reaches that they had explored but they did not need one particular Commander. No, he could have been replaced, quite easily, and likely with someone who would be more easily manipulated. One who sat in the palm of the Military Police. It was either him or Eren together or Eren alone. For Eren, there had been no way out. Death had awaited him no matter what."
"It's enough of a burden to deal with one life, let alone two. Even worse when you find an old lover from the last one who doesn't remember it - not consciously anyway. But that doesn't matter to Erwin. No, as long as Eren is by his side, memories or not, he'll be content to hold him close and hope he never has to remember those horrors."

Will Eren make that choice or is safe to say that fate has lamentations mapped out for the rest of his life."

Finally feeling grown up and independent, they move into their own apartments, but in the same building of course. While studying, partying and catching up with old friends, Eren and Mikasa chase sparks between them, while Jean fights for her attention."
"Eren was never one to focus on relationships. He was always zeroed in on his grades, much like his best friend, Armin, and shied away from strangers. He never went to parties or the school dances; he was antisocial. When news of a certain quarterback joined the football team at the end of his Freshman year, Eren couldn't help but develop a small crush on the raven-haired man. His Sophomore year rolled around and he desperately tries to tell himself that there's no way a popular Junior like Levi could ever like a nerd such as himself. It wouldn't work out.

"Levi watched as the titan picked Eren's mother up from the debris. One move and he could cut the nape of the titan's neck and save Carla, but he didn't move a muscle, instead choosing to watch the titan eat the woman. He smiled, wanting nothing more than to see Carla get eaten by the monster so that she couldn't keep Eren from him anymore. He'd remove everyone in his way in order to have Eren all to himself. But, as years pass by, the young adult's interest to join the survey corps becomes yet another obstacle."
"Tall, blonde Captain Erwin Smith is the perfect method to extract funds from noblemen‚Äôs desperate wives and when the Survey Corps bring in dirty, bedraggled, beautiful Levi with his promiscuous glares, this method of funding seems to have a long and virtuous future. Levi seems to have no problem, and even prefers serving men whilst Erwin shudders at this vulgarity, but as he is promoted to Commander and his prostitution ceased, he finds himself becoming intrigued by the practice of this homosexuality, and by Levi."
"We all know that Levi is humanity's strongest, and that he's been through some tough shit. This love story takes place in the modern world, and it shows Levi's emotional and mental struggles and changes as he slowly grows close to Eren - something he had hoped he never would. Levi used to work in a kindergarten (and he wasn't a big fan of it). Twelve years later he's a librarian in a high school. Eren Jaeger is a 2nd grade student, and also one of the children he watched in kindergarten. And guess what, Levi somehow ends up having to babysit this brat for five weeks because the kid broke some rules (and by babysitting, I mean Eren has to help Levi clean the library).

"Levi has always hated the hero names the public has come up with for him. 'Humanity's Strongest,' he despised. 'Captain' wouldn't have been so bad, if it weren't so blatantly coined off of Erwin's hero name, 'Commander.' Of course, now they're calling him the fucking 'Wings of Freedom.' Wings of Shit, Levi thinks bitterly. The post-MHA AU no one asked for. In the era after Deku's generation, Levi struggles to harness his quirk as he and Erwin lead the Survey Corps hero agency against the growing titan threat. Featuring the veterans both as teenagers and adults."

"ABANDONED FOR GOOD. -- It's a thin line between love and hate is what they say. It ain't easy being teenager and trying to cope with sexual frustration, finding your identity in the ever-changing world, and realising that the person who pisses you off more than anything else in the world is the person of whom you dream even when awake. So basically Jean hates Eren until one day something happens, and he's left confused about his own sexuality, feelings for Eren and other teenager-y shit. Existential angst at its best. High school! au that is so unoriginal that it hurts."

"I did my best not to let my insecurities show to anyone. I kept them inside, locking them away behind bars made of iron. I swallowed any evidence that might have given me away, even as I asked her to marry me. I can‚Äôt even pinpoint when I began to develop these feelings. Was it just my anxiety? Or was this something more? Did I still love her? Was I still in love with her? She was the most understanding, thoughtful, kind-hearted partner I‚Äôve ever had, and yet I still felt this way. God, what is wrong with me? Or where Eren is a college student and begins to doubt his relationship with his fianc√©e, the feelings only getting worse as he meets someone new."

"Eren was good. He went to church each Sunday, he was able to control his anger issues, and had decent grades even with his short-attention span. He loved his family and his God more than anything else in his life, and despite wanting to be travel the world, Eren knew that he would eventually follow his father and become the next pastor of Shiganshina's church. Until he met Levi, and began to question everything he had ever done. Eren had always been certain that disobeying God - that sinning - was wrong. But if it was, then why did it feel so good? When he sneaked out to see Levi, when Levi convinced him to drink alcohol, when Levi kissed his cheek - Eren had never felt more alive in his life. By the time he noticed, Eren was far too gone to even care that Levi was ruining his innocence. [Do not re-upload to another site]"

"Levi reminds Eren what it means to be human."
"Levi stared at Eren without muttering a single word. His grey eyes were burning holes in his body, and a shiver ran down Eren‚Äôs spine. It was unnerving to have the man right there, so close and yet so far from him, so distant and silent."

Things start to look up for Jean. And as the saying goes, life gets better. But then again, as some people handle situations, some situations handle people. Shadows of the mind is about the struggle of living with depression/anxiety and how much of an effect it can have on a person's life and to see if teenage romance can overcome the crushing pressure of one's mind, whether it can be a light to banish the darkness.And I want to make this clear, depression is not romantic in any way and it is not my intention to romanticize depression/anxiety in any way. if I have gone about it the wrong way please let me know.

"‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs gone to their cabins,‚Äù Eren said, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. In the dim light of the candles, Levi could see the faint blush on his cheeks. His lips stretched in a tiny smirk. Eren had never been good at being subtle. ‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù he asked, raising an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt tired yet.‚Äù Eren bit his bottom lip and Levi would have given him everything he had in that moment, but he had nothing to offer him, so he simply put down the cup of tea and stood up. ‚ÄúCome,‚Äù he said, and headed to his bedroom."

"In a world where your soul mates name is on your right wrist, not having a name there sort of really sucks. But what sucks more is when your great great grandmothers‚Äô spirit has taken a stake in your love life. But see, that‚Äôs not the point. The point of the matter is that college, hormones, and meddling spirits were really hard to manage all at once. Not to mention rebels and political upheaval. But none of that compared though. What made things really difficult was, during all of that, I was falling in love, and that? That was the hardest part."

"Year 854 - One Week Before Liberio. Mikasa is a contradiction, in so many ways.  The strongest of them is the most fragile and prone to crumbling. The most placid of them has emotions churning wildly beneath the surface, threatening to overwhelm her. The bravest of them is the one whose dreams leave her whimpering in her sleep - begging Eren Jaeger to come home. Manga Spoilers Ahead..."
"His eyes brimmed with tears when he spotted him through the windows. He hadn‚Äôt changed much, but at the same time, he was different. Although the scars didn‚Äôt fade, only uneven rosy and white-ish lines remained. Levi kept his right eye uncovered, but he wore some kind of prosthesis for his two missing fingers -no doubt. Hange‚Äôs doing-. But apart from that, he was just the same. With more wrinkles and greys, but his clothes were pristine, and instead of his cravat, he had added an apron to his attire.

When Commander Erwin Smith‚Äôs right hand man, Levi Ackerman, goes undercover to spy on the revolutionaries, he meets Eren Jaeger, a revolutionary planning to overthrow Erwin. their worlds collide in ways they never expected they would.

But as an epidemic sweeps across the country, he realized that he was caught between his conflicting emotions for his friend that left him, and for the consequences he was about to face when he decided to follow him."
"The hissed words barrelled to the forefront of his mind, a conversation from years past recalled so clearly he could almost let himself drown in the wild delusion that she was stood right there beside him, a shadow speaking from beyond a common soldiers grave."

She watches as Niccolo twines his hands with Sasha‚Äôs, how Eren is playing with the ends of Armin‚Äôs golden hair ‚Äì and wishes that it was her. She heaves a sigh, marred with discontent and bitterness, raising the rifle once again with haste and falling back into her usual posture for shooting. Desperately, she pushes down all the nonsensical thought and feelings bubbling up within her, quick to quash the intensity of them before they morph into something else. She clenches her teeth and aims down the sights, and fires. Direct hit. Mikasa wants and longs for people that she cannot have."

"Jean Kirschstein is 19 years old, lives alone, has a boring part-time job at an organic grocery store, has four friends in the whole world (not including his dog), goes through life day after day with very little change, and has absolutely no impact on anyone or anything. Oh and he talks to ghosts. That's kind of important."
"Eren's changed recently. Mikasa isn't sure she likes it but he's still the boy she loves. Even if his actions are becoming more evil everyday."
"Tomorrow, they will venture to retake Wall Maria. Tonight, Levi wonders if the ocean is as blue as Erwin's eyes. The funny thing about all of this nonsensical sentimentalism is that Levi knows Erwin doesn‚Äôt love him. Hell, Levi isn‚Äôt entirely sure that Erwin is capable of romantic love, or any kind of love, really. But that has never been a problem for Levi. Erwin may not love him, but Erwin understands him. Their relationship has always been based on precisely that: understanding. The fact that Levi is, after all, in love with him is trivial."
"After the war is won and the remaining Levi Squad retires from the military, Eren receives a parting gift from a friend as he leaves. He keeps a portrait of her on the mantle above the fireplace in the living room. Not in his bedroom, he'd see it too often. But in the living room so that he may cut his eyes toward her on his way in and out the front door. Heading out, Ma. I'm home, Ma. In the living room above the fireplace so that she may forever reside warm and safe above the flickering embers in the hearth, kept under his watchful eye where no one can hurt her. Not again."
"Titans roam the outside world striking fear in the hearts of many. Ghouls hide amongst the humans. Both species opponents in a flesh-eating war that never seems to end. Eren is the victim of cruel experiments that he has no memory of cause his body to change and develop into something more than human. Or an Attack on Titan/Tokyo Ghoul crossover in which an older Eren pisses Levi off to no end."
"Note: SPOILERS through the end of the third season! Bertholdt Hoover's last memory was of falling in the battle to retake Shiganshina.  When he wakes up in a dark, cold room with his arms and legs missing and a female Corps member telling him to be quiet, Bertholdt is terrified, but it turns out she's actually saving him from a horrible fate.  They both have to make sense of what happened and find their way out of the city."
"A story about the development of Marco and Jean's relationship told from their early days as trainees to the great soldiers they turned out to be in the end."
"""Wonder what we could be living in another life; catch us in the mirror and it looks a lot like love."" An unfortunate accident, as well as obvious differences in ideologies, made hating the newest recruit of the Survey Corps so easy. But time proved that falling in love with him was actually even easier. The seemingly lost world, though, taught you that loving him was complicated. And a twist of fate made leaving him by far the hardest part."
"Forced to share bunks, Eren gets pissed at Jean for singing (badly) in his sleep. Survey Corps get a day off and the two have to spend it together. And then they're forced to clean the stables at night. Oh,  how the world hates Eren and Jean, but not as much as they think. [Indirect sequel]"
"Maybe, to end this hell, to stay death after dying again, maybe Erwin needs to find a way to save Levi and himself. Maybe he needs to find a way to save more people, to do something. Eruri Week 2019 Day 7: Timeloop"
"You stumble across Levi and Hange unexpectantly in the forest where you live. Whilst you care for an injured Levi, will feelings grow?"
"Caraphernelia; A broken-heart disease whenever someone leaves you but leaves all their things behind. Levi's an asshole, Eren knows, in the same way he knows that he should not have let his hopes up; though he still can't help the crack he definitely feels and hears inside is chest as he leaves, and nobody follows him. He knew this would happen; he wast too much of an idiot to accept it sooner and spare himself the pain. Now he has to live with the consequences that come with dating (or attempting to date) someone like Levi."
"He didn‚Äôt look like how he should. Eren Jaeger was successful. He was a MLB prospect. He was everything that this Eren wasn‚Äôt anymore. His friends back home probably wouldn‚Äôt even recognize him like this."
"Eren's thoughts after learning of Sasha's death."
"The first time he remembers is the moment Erwin's heart stops beating. For a split second, a sharp pain races through his head, leaving him dizzy and faint. What follows is a brutal, overwhelming onslaught of memories ‚Äì memories of a future that is yet to come. Or memories of a time long past? It's all fragmented, distorted, chaotic. When Levi opens his eyes again, he sees the world in a new light. It's like he has woken up from a long dream. ‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù asks Hanji, their voice broken and hoarse. They look at him with concern. It is a stupid question, really, and they both know. Because nothing is alright any more. ***** My entry for the 2019 Eruriweek Prompt: Timeloop"

"Armin: an above average high school senior also known as The Man with the Plan Eren: a below average high school senior also known as The Charmer Hangi: a scientist also known as The Researcher Levi: lead singer of the popular rock band Survey Corps also know as The Clean-up or The Killer Mikasa: an average high school senior also known as The Killer Together they make up the government's most covert and coveted group of assassins: The Titans."
"The night Levi and Farlan's friendship changed into something else."
"It's one of those days when Levi can't stop thinking about Erwin and he just feels totally empty inside..."
"Upon King Jaeger's orders, soldiers are sent to fight a war against an adjacent Kingdom to reclaim what was once theirs. Among these warriors is Princess Eren Jaeger's secret husband, Levi, so when none of the soldiers return to the kingdom, she takes it upon herself to find him, but perhaps she won't, and maybe she has truly lost it all."
"... Once the wall titans break free from their prison, devestation and terror devours the world. In the midst of it all, Eren tells Armin one last thing he needed to do in order to end the war once and for all. One question is certain; How far are he and Mikasa willing to go? [Post 121]"
"There's no real reason or logic to explain it. But if Levi has to come up with something, he'd settle for a shrug and a ""That's just how life is."" It's far neater than explaining about his previous life as ""Humanity's Strongest Soldier."" So if you can stop laughing, Eren, Levi would really appreciate it."
"The battle of Shiganshina wore the scouts thin. You and Levi met in the underground and went through everything together since then. Haunted by grief and trauma from your lives, you try your best to take care of those around you in spite of everything you‚Äôve gone through. In his own way, Levi tries to keep you safe from the horrors of your world only for the two of you to struggle and endure loss after loss."

"None"
"Once upon a time, I thought you were something special."
"Armin shrinks Reiner and Bertholdt and swallows them whole.  The Survey Corps congratulates him, but Armin feels regretful and runs off to vomit up his former friends.  He wonders if a deal can be made between the two Titan Shifters and the Survey Corps. In the midst of all this, Reiner and Bertholdt confess their feelings for one another."
"Levi is Done with the world around him, sick of being secondary and forever unable to find a place where he feels appreciated as a person. Living alone, avoiding everyone in sight is how Eren has decided to atone for the failures in his life. Somehow they find themselves in each other in a way they hadnt found in anyone before. Discontinued and up for adoption!"
"Podfic of starsinew's 'these clothes don't fit us right' - They are tin soldiers, steadfast and gleaming bright in the somnolent afternoon sun, and time hasn‚Äôt slowed for them but suspended- this is his now just as it is his forever, and Eren knows he can love. Tomorrow, twenty-three of them will die. (or: Armin's mouth is full of stars, but the world is dark, and Eren knows that real life doesn't look like pictures in books)"
"Nile wasn't ready to let go of Erwin when the day came that they had to go their separate ways."
"Growing up, Eren's mother had told him he couldn't go outside Shiganshina because his village was different from the rest of the world. She said the world wouldn't understand him because he was special, and that made it dangerous. But Eren wanted to see what lies beyond the only place he's ever known. He could never have imagined that one day his mother's warning would be proved right in the most horrifying way, showing him the darkest side of the human world. Is Eren fated to spend his life as a caged animal?"
"New unknown creatures, a cave in the middle of nowhere and a portal that links them to the past and to the future. As if the titans and Marley weren‚Äôt enough, now they have to deal with potential new enemies, the past, the present, the future, and a war that crosses timelines."
"When Levi gets mortally injured saving Eren, he has to deal with the consequences of his actions and just his actions in general. SLIGHT Eren X Levi. Rated T for language. Just read it."

"They find their world in each other..."
"Eren Yeager is well-known. He's the son of his town's doctor, adopted brother to Mikasa, one of the best member's of his high school's football team, and loyal boyfriend to Annie Leonhart. Or so the story goes. In truth, Eren doesn't know what's wrong with him. His girlfriend does nothing for him, and it's getting to a point where he can't even perform the way she wants. He should be able to, by all accounts, his girlfriend is hot, and he's not so bad himself. It just won't work, nothing works. And then he meets his adopted sister's cousin, and it all makes sense. Eren is seventeen, Levi is eighteen. This is a very smut-heavy fic, too. Give a teenager a willing partner, and well, you know what happens."
"It‚Äôs been two years of new developments and new allies for the people of the walls; but for one person- It‚Äôs been two years of hell. The world seemed to be bleak, it‚Äôs colored drained and muted. A lone black horse and it‚Äôs solemn rider made their way to pair of houses not yet touched by man. Had the sacrifice been worth it? One hundred and ninety nine lives lost in a suicide charge and for what? For the Attack Titan to turn on its allies and flee their home; never to be seen again. The sun started to rise over the horizon casting long shadows among the still bloodstained grass."
"On the quiet bank of a river, Levi remembers his vow."
"Erwin summoned Levi to his office to have him sign some papers concerning Eren's transference to the Survey Corps. However, after finishing up with the task at hand, the corporal ends up enlightening Erwin with a glimpse into his past."
"He doesn't spend a second thinking about himself. Instead, his thoughts are focused on Erwin, lying in that bed back home."
"""With every trip to the beach and every seashell, he had hoped to pull Eren a little bit closer, to remind him a little bit more of what connected the two of them, to bring a little bit more passion back into his heart. To see Eren's eyes light up again like they would when they were kids and dreaming in front of an old book."""
"This takes place post Season 3 of the show. Eren and Levi find solace in eachother."
"As you know my name is Marco Kirschtein and hopefully you as my children are reading this. This in case you hadn't guessed already is my memoir as to how I not only met the love of my life but how my life changed completely."

"Armin, Mikasa, Jean, Connie and Sasha all find themselves reincarnated with memories of their past lives. After years of wondering where Eren could be, one day in class he gets introduced as the new student. He has a hopeful smile on his face and no memories of his past life. A radiant smile that starts vanishing as the weeks go by... This time, his friends aren't going to stand and watch their friend get consumed by his own sadness. This time, they will be next to him."

"Future AU. Marco was once a rebel, who was taken by the government for speaking out. Jean, who lost his best friend and soul mate, joined his former group to avenge him. It's been five years. One of the government's top soldiers has been captured by the resistance. He looks just like him, sounds just like him, and Jean wants to believe that he's the same person. But Marco doesn't remember a thing."
"Eren has seen Jean kiss his blades when he's scared that something might go wrong, so he picks up on to that."

"The walls have been torn down, government disbanded and titans exist no more, only to be replaced with supernatural creatures. An unofficial sequel to Selfish Desires. AlphaxOmega Chapter 9 and 10 will have LevixArmin themes."
"Eren is nearly silent, and for once, she is glad. He is under her‚Äîpliant, sweat gathering on his brow and the base of his neck, mouth agape with quiet gasping breaths as she fucks him; a hand planted squarely in the centre of his chest as she drives her hips forward."
"Two people taking care of each other. Giving comfort."
"The head of treasury glances at them. Hanji smiles and waves while saying ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù in a tone that sounded like ‚Äúhello‚Äù. It certainly wasn‚Äôt Bonjour, and the expression that formed on the head of treasury‚Äôs face indicated that he thought that exact thing for a moment. Since he clearly doesn‚Äôt know French, he doesn‚Äôt think much of it, and waves back smiling cheerfully. Levi almost chokes to avoid laughing."
"‚ÄúYou used to tell me I was your hope,‚Äù Eren said quietly. ‚ÄúYou told me you trusted me, that you‚Äôd always trust me.‚Äù Levi's jaw clenched. Hadn‚Äôt that same thought crossed his mind in the forest? ‚ÄúA lot‚Äôs happened since then,‚Äù he said instead. For EreriWritingPrompt13: Natsukashii"

"Eren didn't know when dreams of the past started coming to him. He couldn't remember a time when the life he was living was the only life in his head. Armin realized early on that his memories came in two distinct sets, separate from each other but equally valid. He concluded easily that the life he was leading was not his first. Mikasa awoke with a start at age nine to find tears on her cheeks and a picture in her mind, the image of a boy she was sure she had never seen before, but somehow felt indebted to. Something deep in her subconscious was telling her that she had to find this boy, lest something terrible happen to him. Armin once told Eren about a theory he'd read, that people are reincarnated over and over until they learn the lesson they are meant to learn, or serve the purpose they are meant to serve. Eren can't help but think they've missed their chance to do anything of real significance. They'd failed to defeat the titans. What did the universe want from them, if not that?"
"And the plot develops, or whatever. Or, Levi deals with some inner conflict while simultaneously dealing with some ‚Äòfamily‚Äô conflict as well. He comes out bruised but Hange is there to patch him up of course. They cuddle I promise. This one is long."

"Levi finds himself going back to 505 and back to Eren."

"‚ÄúHow did you sleep, darling?‚Äù his mother said as she planted a kiss on his forehead and placed a plate of food before him. Levi stared at the food before him, mind quickly side-tracking due to his fatigue. ‚ÄúFine. It was another memory.‚Äù Kuchel gave a weak smile as she stroked her son‚Äôs back. Their family had certainly gotten luckier in this life. A life where Levi has his mother, but still lacked a father‚Äôs presence. A life where he was considerably taller than in his past life, reaching 4 inches taller than before; still growing. A life where he felt considerably lonely. Was it because of that teal eyed brunette he‚Äôs been dreaming about these last few days? Perhaps. Since regaining his memories at the ripe age of 16, Levi has been lifeless as ever, more so than he was originally. The day Eren died was the day Levi became lifeless. Living to survive rather than fulfilling the true meaning of life, for without Eren, life held no meaning at all, at least to Levi it didn't."

He helps people, and then he vanishes. But when he saves a rather hostile man from being mowed down by an over-enthusiastic bus driver on the streets of Trost, he doesn‚Äôt get the reaction he expects. He gets shouted at for helping, for saving, and realises that sometimes people don‚Äôt want to be saved, or worse still, don‚Äôt think they should be. He also begins to find that no matter how hard he tries, he can't pull himself away from the one person who destroyed his universe... and then put it together again. One thing's for certain: it's going to be a hard pill to swallow."

Lies there and pants, his heart slamming in his chest, and then wipes an arm across his eyes, and rolls out of bed. His knees aren‚Äôt quite steady and his face is flushed; and he slides on his slippers and wraps his housecoat tight around himself, and then crosses the room to splash some water on his face. Ends up leaning over the basin with his hands holding tight to the table, doing his best to not look in the mirror, because he really doesn‚Äôt like what he sees there. This is horrible. - - - (Now with a gorgeous French translation by alonia. Thank you again. ‚ô•)"

"He sees a strong chin and the point of a nose, strands of hair dark as the starless night and for the first time in a while he relaxes. Shuts his eyes and shuffles deeper into the chest he‚Äôs known for many nights. A part of him realizes what this means, the utter chaos that they have left in their wake, the fact that he‚Äôll be marked traitor as well and his friends are now out of reach forever.

He stroked the rough pads of his thumbs across the tender skin just under her breasts. Then he waited. He knew the wine had loosened her inhibitions, and she would eventually tell him what she wanted if he was patient. And Levi was a very patient man. ‚ÄúTell me what you‚Äôre going to do to me,‚Äù she whispered in his ear, sending chills down his spine, making his groin tighten as she ran her tongue along the outer shell of his ear.

It was not an uncommon sight to see Levi covered in blood, though it quickly became harder to tell if it was from titans or his friends.

Was it possible that Levi saw Eren as more than a hot-headed, barely competent assistant? Did Eren's feelings have any chance of being requited or was he hopelessly falling deeper down the rabbit hole for an engaged older man?

Levi, on the other hand, has different thoughts. ""Love"" is just a beautiful lie. It indeed doesn't exist.

It is only later he realises that no matter how many letters he wrote, how many hours he spent looking for Levi wouldn't bring him back. After the war AU.

This time in the form of a Marleyan doctor with eyes like golden honey and sunshine. Doctor Elena Schneider tends to Levi's wounds. She is not like other Marleyans and has never harbored ill will towards Eldians, instead always seeing them as just people.  During Levi's long and intensive recovery, he finds himself enraptured in the fiery doctor and he goes from ready to die on that battlefield to finding that perhaps there are more reasons to live than just fighting. He wonders what fate awaits him the moment he is released from her care and he finds himself dreading that day and unprepared when it comes all too soon. Will Levi find the courage to tell Elena how he feels before he leaves or will he live his life regretting never confessing to the only woman he ever fell in love with?"
"You eased Erwin Smith's head tensions with your voice only to give him a full-blown headache right after, and he can't just let that pass. His concert companion was killed in cold blood. It stained his trench coat. He was interrogated until late midnight. And god, he didn't get his sleep back. Nonetheless, it doesn't take his astuteness to realize you're very much needed as one of his pretty little wildcards."
"This is my submission for the Eruri Matchmaking 2022!

"At twenty years old, Mikasa thinks she‚Äôs been through more than most ‚Äì her mother‚Äôs dead because of her, her father is an addict in denial because of her, and now she‚Äôs the shadow of the girl she used to be. At twenty years old, Mikasa thinks she‚Äôs too young to be starting fresh ‚Äì but she still moves across the country to leave everything behind in the hopes of forgetting a life that will never be again. At twenty years old, Mikasa can‚Äôt understand why in a new city, with no familiar faces, someone already knew who she was, and worse ‚Äì he seemed to know how she‚Äôd gotten that scar on her cheek, too."
"They treat her like the sinless creature she is, rearing her up amongst themselves, the generous men and women of the Corps, instead of trusting the intricacies of childcare with her parents who have been deemed fitful and flighty. (Somewhere in Hange‚Äôs office there is a document stating that: custody.)"
"""She‚Äôd never have thought, all those weeks ago when she‚Äôd first awoken with vomit on the pillows and a night missing from her memory, that she‚Äôd be listless and bedridden by the turn of the month."""

"But now, when he touches her, it‚Äôs different. There‚Äôs something behind it, the innocence and the original intention lost in the way he handles her, pads of his thumbs dragging across soft skin like he knows it better than she does, like he holds something far less virtuous back, straining, longing. She can hear it in his voice, and feel it in his fingertips."

"Although Berlin's club scene is considered one of the most exciting in Europe, Mikasa's life is incredibly boring. Her friends' parties are always the same and it's been ages since she last had sex... At one of these parties, she unexpectedly meets an attractive young man who triggers her desire at first sight. But in what emotional chaos he will still plunge her, she understands only after their shared passionate night."
"As he calls for someone to retrieve the soldier‚Äôs corpse, he notices something in the distance. Levi looks harder. What he sees appears to be a lost horse but not just any horse: a white horse. or What if Erwin‚Äôs horse survives the last charge and now wanders aimlessly outside the Walls. One day, the horse gets encountered by a broken familiar face. They both got something in common: Erwin."
"All I ever wanted to do was do right things I never wanted to be the king, I swear All I ever wanted to do was save your life I never wanted to grab a knife, I swear The Rumbling has come to Eorzea. It falls to the Scions of the Seventh Dawn to protect that which they hold dear yet again, with a little bit of help along the way. For they are not slaves. Nor are they gods. They are just humans."
"How ironic‚Ä¶ Leaving her with the means to keep Levi from immediately dying of his injuries only for them to face starvation or exposure."
"Sometimes, all you can do is wait, no matter how much it hurts."
"Levi finds out he's in ""complicated circumstances."" He goes to Erwin with the good, or not so good, news. Warning: spoilers up to chapter 49, inexplicable mpreg."
"Mikasa lives and loves again."
"Historia would die with no regrets. She promised herself that, and she found that as the days passed she prayed more for her goal than for her life itself. Please, she thinks. Let me have a chance at love before it's too late."
"He does realize, as he pulls a now crying Reiner against his chest and whispers apologies and reassurances, that there is some hypocrisy with how angry he is with Reiner for always giving into Eren. Because he‚Äôs doing the same thing now. Because he‚Äôs told himself time and time again that if Reiner didn‚Äôt stop his bullshit, that he‚Äôd leave. But here he is pulling Reiner close to him and not even trying to resist when Reiner leans up to kiss him."
"Levi dies, and what does Eren have but his hunger?"
"Levi is known as the ‚ÄúFaceless Painter‚Äù. He creates ethereal portraits without painting the subject's face. Because of his artistic quirk, customers are troublesome for him. Along the way he finds himself befriending an unorthodox soldier who takes an interest in Levi‚Äôs artistic abilities.

"""Don't tell."" Levi whispered with an extent of lewd intention in his tone. Erwin held his breath, knowing his pupils were insanely dilated at that very moment, his heart beat accelerating with the thump, thump, thump of his chest that cried sheer desire for more of Levi's touch. Grey narrowed once again, stalking out the position of the commotion within Erwin, clearly recognising the blonde's abrupt reaction to his movement. ""Someone's excited."" He teased breathily, dangerously close to Erwin's ear, burning crimson in deprivation. . . . . . With rumours of another futile war lingering closer, a lonely, depressed soldier walks into a gay club longing for an escape from his misery and meets a blunt and unbothered hooker who believes him to be a closeted breadwinner, without a clue of his true story. (Just a forewarning I'm planning on making this one very sad, so skip straight to the smut marked chapters if you can't be asked for heartburn.)"
"Watching his young self, Eren knows: for Mikasa, he would do anything. This is all for the freedom of Paradis Island, but more than anything, he wants Mikasa to have her freedom. That‚Äôs what everything is really about."
"Torn between memories of past and future, Eren Yeager finds himself in an unprecedented situation. The scale of which is important enough to affect everyone connected to him, for good or ill. It is up for him to find and acquire balance, by any means necessary. The survival of most is dependant on it. Eremika centered, with other ships more or less in the background. Kinda AU. Crossposted on fanfiction.net, but the chapters here are more refined and revised."
"He wasn‚Äôt sure if this was something she had always wanted or if it was more so to do with lack of options. They had never really talked about it or entertained it. It happened so suddenly, Eren had been gone for a year, and Armin had been talking about ways to find him like he always did."
"Based on season 4 episode 14 the table scene with Mikasa, Armin, and Eren. Featuring: Eren being a jerk and Mikasa trying to cope with being hated by the one she loves. Also I suck at summaries."
"‚ùù Meeting you is like Armin seeing the ocean for the first time. ‚ùû * ‚Ä¢‚ú∞ ‚ùù What? ‚ùû you asked, confused.

"I dream of you almost every night, this time, I hope I don‚Äôt wake up. We will be together soon."
"You did it. You crawled your way out of the Underground and were able to start a new life and a new family as a doctor in Wall Rose. You were happy. So then why? Why did you volunteer to become the Survey Corp‚Äôs field medic? Why would you willingly move from one hell to another? And why‚Ä¶ was there something so familiar about the military‚Äôs most bad-tempered captain? Updates weekly(ish)."
"Reader has anger and communication issues, and can‚Äôt deal with confrontation. She also feels sorry for her lack of communication and anger. Eren cheers her up by going on a night drive and taking her to a special spot."
"Ymir is finally ready to ask about her father, but is she going to like the answer?"
"Mikasa visits Eren's grave."
"""You must return, promise me! Promise, that you will come back to me!"" Not everything went according to the plan when Eren chose to transform instead of leading The Female Titan into the trap. Pressed between five most elite titan killers and a titan shifter, Annie proposed an offer. She couldn't die here, after all. She still had a father to return to."
"Levi stood mounted next to him, eyes trained ahead into the distance. He looked exhausted in a way Eren had never seen him before ‚Äì pale as death, shoulders slumped like a great weight bore them down. In that moment, he looked the furthest thing from Humanity‚Äôs Strongest ‚Äì his dark lustre had gone, leaving nothing but the worn, tired old man underneath. They rode side by side in silence as the sun sank into the horizon, Eren staring mindlessly at the back of Levi‚Äôs head. Eren had taken everything from him. And he felt nothing. (Squad Levi dies. Eren's guilt threatens to drown him.)"
"The sudden burst of volume seemingly disturbing the ambience of the surrounding atmosphere, the celestial sky gradually darkens into a sorrowful grey as the enveloping darkness slowly eats away the once captivating troposphere. The once shining sun disappears from their sights as the aloof complexion of the air significantly escalates by means of the metamorphosed sky. Armin stares wide-eyed at Eren's faraway form as he feels a strong sense of fear overcome him; that escalating fear getting bubbled in with the growing regret of his words... Attack on Titan x Avatar the Last Airbender crossover A continuation of events following the ultimate succession of the Rumbling and termination of the Curse of Ymir.

"She sits by the grassy meadow field on one of those rare sunny days where she made sure her schedule was free. A gentle breeze blows and leaves are sent flying as little clouds of dust surround her. There‚Äôs no one else around, and she finds it peaceful as she lays against the old tree, rough bark grazing her back through the silk of her shirt. She pays it no mind as the wind comes to caress her cheeks with its soft touch. It plays with her hair, as short as it was, ruffling it slightly in a messy manner that has her lips turning upwards. One hand tightly clasps around an old brown book, the old coffee-stained papers wrinkling under her fingertip as she lets it fall open on her lap. In her other hand, she holds a feather quill between her fingertips, the end already dipped in black ink. Surrounded by a meadow field of long overgrown green grass, and a tree where the verdant green leaves come to fall gently next to the dirt floor, the words come to her even if she hadn‚Äôt intended them to. And so, she begins to write."
"Armin wasn't a person with great aspirations, he never deemed himself worthy of them. Jean disagreed. The potential he saw in the brilliant mind that stood in front of him was unlike anything he'd seen before. He decided to encourage that. He decided to be the push Armin needed to reach the goals he'd only contemplated in his dreams. But what happens when that push tweaks their relationship? Or, Jearmin Steampunk au where Armin is a genius but has low self esteem and trust issues."

"Historia waits for Eren to return to her."
"It began with flowers. The stalking. The obsession. All of it. Set into motion by a deceptively innocent and lovely bouquet of daisies and white lilies. Pure love. Loyal love. A curse disguised as a blessing. Lilies used to be Levi‚Äôs favorite. Or One year after Eren kidnaps Levi."
"But when she comes to me , salt catches on his lip and dries sharp on his tongue, a stabbing throb beneath his ribs as he envisions his end, the one he wants but could never have in any way that mattered, so real he can taste the runoff of the mountains and the phantom press of lips he‚Äôs never touched. So undeserved, this moment he dreams of, yet his heart longs for it the way his lungs long for air; unrestrained, and selfish. The twisted, unforgivable urge to turn such a grotesque moment into something resembling beauty. Peace, he vies for, in the midst of destruction. A breath of heaven before the flames pull him under for good. I want to see her . He wants to marry her."
"Levi decides to take his own life an october afternoon He does not count on relearning how to live, nor finding reasons to keep going"
"""I loved her so much, I can't even begin to describe it. Which is why it broke me to watch her die in my arms."" After Mikasa's death, Eren isn't sure what to do with himself. He feels responsible, as if he killed Mikasa. Armin feels a different kind of guilt. See, his feelings for Eren put him in a difficult position. It's not very respectful to steal a dead girl's boyfriend. Through Eren's guilt and Armin's shame, can they find love?"
"Evelyn hated her life ‚Äì the yolk of her family name and the unfortunate fate of being the next inheritor of the Warhammer Titan was sucking the life out of her. ‚Ä¶Then a man crashes into her path and offers a new option. To stay or to go? To fight or stand-still? Her choices have unimaginable consequences, it's just a shame Evelyn was too short short-sighted to see this.

"""Take this as a warning, Captain."" the man spat the last word and walked away from him, his henchmen following like dogs. ""Go back to the Underground!""

"Her number is still stored in his phone. Modern AU."
"Erwin nodded, ‚ÄúSure thing‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll see you next week?‚Äù Levi nodded, shooting Erwin a small smile, ‚ÄúYeah. I look forward to it.‚Äù Erwin could feel his heart racing - I look forward to it. That had to mean something, didn‚Äôt it? Levi wouldn‚Äôt just say that if he didn‚Äôt feel something towards Erwin - if they didn‚Äôt have some sort of reciprocating feelings between them. But Erwin was a little too scared to test the waters right now, so he simply discarded the condom and pulled his uniform back on. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you then,‚Äù Levi waved, sitting down on the bed and watching Erwin wave back before he left."
"‚ÄòLevi continues studying Eren‚Äî critically, fearfully, almost obsessively‚Äî because he feels the static in the air grow with every day, and he knows it‚Äôs only a matter of time.‚Äô Oneshot for the ‚ÄòSave the Date‚Äô Ereri server event."

"Levi is a Knight, who suddenly disappeared one night with his men. Queen Historia and her court needs to find a solution to their lack of protection before Titans attack her city."
"The room was set up the same way it'd been years ago. There was a bizarre feeling of melancholy that came with coming into the nursery that she and her husband had excitedly put together years ago. Back then they‚Äôd been so excited and happy to look forward to the future. Things were different now than they were back then. (Day one for Reibert Week 2022! Prompt is gender swap)"

""There was a small sad smile on his face as he brought the plant inside and sat it down on his desk. ‚Äò Some poor girl will never learn how much they‚Äôre loved. ‚Äô White carnations meant gratitude and pure love after all. Nevertheless, he was going to take good care of the plant. He just hoped the mysterious lover boy will find the right window next time because he really didn‚Äôt want to be woken up again unnecessarily.

"Armin was new in town and living with his Opa, a man he‚Äôd never really met before except for in a few brief moments in his childhood. He was in a foreign city and felt so, so isolated. That is, until he found a mailbox that allowed you to be penpals with kids in the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, and he got a letter back from one Eren Jaeger. Told through a collage of memories, letters, and glimpses of the present, Armin tries to piece together the exact path that led to where he is now, living on a peaceful, quiet farmland in Germany with the former inmate, and whether or not he regrets anything."
"He was running out of time, everyone knew that. And what Eren Yeager regretted the most out of all his poor decisions within his lifetime, was that he never told Mikasa Ackerman how he really felt. During his time in solitude, he has all the time in the world to think this over. Especially when there's a recollection of memories shared between Eren and Mikasa looking back at the time he lost and what he could‚Äôve had."
"Thank Goddess, the guy is alive. He has several injuries all over his body but he‚Äôs alive, though unconscious. The man puts him in one of the many bedrooms on the second floor. He cleans the wounds along his body, taking longer in the face. It‚Äôs like forgetting the words of your favorite song. So familiar and so strange at the same time. Suddenly, the guy opens his eyes. That green. That sight. It punches him in the chest, his breath fails. A whisper leaves the injured lips: ‚Äòbrother‚Äô, and he shuts unconscious again. Zeke can‚Äôt remember the name. Neither the ‚Äòwhere‚Äô nor the ‚Äòwhen‚Äô. But he knows the guy. Deep in his heart, he knows.

"Armin knows now that the world is cold, cruel and merciless. It was never meant to be a garden bed, only a prison. And yet in the shadows of the stone walls, there are little roses growing in the cracks, waiting to be counted and loved."
"His eye tingled with threatening tears and he doesn't know if it was from the horrid smell of the dead titans around him or from the faces appearing in the smoke before him."
"‚ÄúPetra was bringing up the rear, and her fear turned to horror as she watched Levi‚Äôs horse take off, riderless, inadvertently kicking him in the chest, and then upside the head as her powerful hind hooves left the ground. His body was thrown back, his head hit a tree, and he did not rise. ‚ÄúCaptain!‚Äù Petra cried and turned her horse away from the jump, hastily dismounting and dashing to his aid. ‚ÄúPetra, no!‚Äù Eld cried as he looked back at the scene. The squad couldn‚Äôt stop, couldn‚Äôt go back for fallen soldiers. Even if the soldier was Captain Levi. There was red smoke behind them, another titan that couldn‚Äôt be more than half a mile away.

"Armin's head pounded, in one hand he was so angry that he wanted to burn everything in his path, wanted to punch Eren for always having something smart to say, and for never liking Annie to begin with. He wanted to go back and find Historia and tell her she had no right to be answering any phone calls of his and not even letting him know, he wanted to tell Annie to go away and leave him alone once and for all, and on the other hand everything made so much sense now.

He could see the horrible bite Levi had suffered in his stomach, the guts that were spilling out of him as his breathing became heavier and heavier. Levi let out a quiet sob, looking up at Erwin with something like desperation in his eyes. Erwin had tears rolling down his face. He didn‚Äôt know what the fuck to do. He and Levi had been¬† traversing the zombie apocalypse for months now together, and a hoard of zombies had just attacked their camper. Erwin was able to fight off the zombies, but Levi had gotten bit, and Erwin had fought off the last of the zombies, shooting them in the head while Levi lay on the ground bleeding out."
"Erwin and Levi have been through their own wars and battles. Leaving one physically scarred, and both mentally damaged. Healing is hard, and for Erwin, his world seems nothing but stagnant and seamless. Levi has never known how  to communicate using words and would rather sit alone in silence. But they can learn how to take the baby steps together."
"Armin can't sleep while he's reeling from the side effects of his new Titan inheritance. Before he could wrestle with it further, Mikasa pays him a visit."
"Just a little eren excerpt that I wrote for myself and wanted to share here as well. This is basically an eren character study (?) if that‚Äôs what you would call it. Includes depictions of carla‚Äôs death, chapter 131, the rumbling, and eren‚Äôs internal thoughts/feelings."
"It‚Äôs 1932 during the great depression and prohibition.  Eren is fortunate enough to have a job and a place to live.  When he sees a gorgeous man, Levi, who is down on his luck and homeless, he struggles to forge a connection with the depressed man."
"Levi has unexpected desires towards a young boy who goes by Eren Jaeger, who eventually has an undying hatred for Levi in light of all that he has done to him."
"After getting released from prison, Levi's learning his place as a sober person getting his life on track. While working on a usual shift he meets Erwin Smith, the man who he can't stop thinking about."
"Men were not meant to sleep in trenches, love."
"When Annie closed her eyes, she could see Mina."
"This is the prologue to Your favorite flowers! this can be taken platonically or romanically, idm ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Angst!!"
"It‚Äôs a difficult question‚Ä¶ Which would you rescue: Erwin, or the spit-sparkled pewter key to some old fuck‚Äôs basement?"
"Levi is struggling with his mental health and is in the midst of a breakdown. With his own thoughts telling him to leave and his heart telling him to stay, he can't help but confront Erwin about the 'truth' when it comes to what he believes the next step in their relationship is. Putting Erwin first no matter how much it will break him is Levi's priority, after all you'll do anything for the one you love...Won't you?"
"Marco's just lucky his career didn't end before it even got started, but as he's climbed the ranks of the medical team, he can't help but wonder if being surrounded by all this death is worth the effort of his survival. AU where Marco survived, but can't remember why."
"Levi raises a toast in honour of the friends he has lost. As he relives painful memories and promises from the past, he finds that the burden of his grief is made lighter in the company of those he loves. [Levihan] [One Shot] [Spoiler warning for Anime-onlys]"
"Written using a first-sentence generator: ""He hadn't seen the old man since"" Squad Levi is returning from a long expedition beyond the walls, yet a key member of the team is missing with no explanation."
"you were the only one that could help him, or so he thought."
"‚ÄúHe wishes he can keep doing this, treating her so gently, the way she deserves to be. He knows that he can‚Äôt though, he knows, and it breaks him everyday. ‚Äú or, mikasa visits eren in prison instead, and begins a spiral of events"
"Eren‚Äôs had a hard life, but even monsters can change I feel a deep emotional connection to eren. Vent posts"
"There was no point. There was nothing left to live for. Nothing to give a damn about. No one waiting on him for when he got out, especially since he'd be in a pine box. Well, maybe Hanji would be there. She still visited him, her and Mike and Nanaba and Erwin. Probably because they knew why he'd done it, why he'd said ""fuck you"" to the law and thrown himself into a veritable suicide mission. And they still loved him, even if he was a murderer, even if Levi was no longer there."
"When Erwin and Hange had dared Levi to be nice to Eren for a week, he certainly hadn't expected half of his comrades to suddenly start thinking they were dating. There are a lot of people complaining (Namely, Eren and Levi.) ------ A fic in which I slander Ereri (with plot!!) because it is a pedophilic excuse of a ship and I despise all of its enjoyers."
"When Porco‚Äôs death finally catches up to her, the grief is as strong as her love for him. A eulogy to the love that has nowhere to go."
"He hated him the first time he met him. But why is it after all this time, it hurts just to look at his peaceful face on that roof?"
"""Scars were lines, just simple marks on the body. Or so, that was what her eyes convinced her to see. And at that moment, she was desperate to believe it, even when her hazy reality was telling her something else."" Hange survives the war but loses too much of herself and Levi is there to pick her back up."
"An exhausted and curious queen and knight on her day off head to town, that's how it all started. Ymir bumped into Historia and the queen was intrigued by this knight that couldn't have cared less to apologize. Taken aback by an intense feeling of familiarity, Historia aches to know more about the knight, wondering if she felt it too."
"If a head should roll, God willing, it would be hers. [SI/OC]"

Captain Levi is satisfied enough with her ability to survive through countless situations, but still finds her to be a nuisance. They‚Äôve both experienced extreme loss while being in the Survey Corps. Lucy suffers from survivor‚Äôs guilt as countless squad members perish at the hands of the titans. After a survey gone wrong, a blizzard forces the pair to seek shelter where their limits are put to the test. Can Levi‚Äôs strength and Lucy‚Äôs luck help them make it out alive? Takes place 1 year after the fall of Wall Maria. Levi and OC are both 25."
"""I should warn you, Captain,"" he says. His eyes darken. Erwin glances down at his hands on the rich wood of his sculpted desk; pale, slender things. The skin is swollen and broken on three of his knuckles. He glances back at him. ""I will never trust someone like you. You can squirm and dance, use your pretty words and your pretty voice all you want. I won't buy any of your bullshit. And you will never really have me."" Erwin nods calmly. ""Sounds like a challenge to me."" A few months after Levi is recruited into the Corps, his relationship with Erwin changes him forever."
"This is a collection of chapters related to the fic Protect and Serve that weren't part of the main storyline. There are different POVs, backstories, and a variety of other things related to the original story: Eren Jaeger has a secret, one that is tearing him apart. Alcohol is the only thing that is holding him together, and it is breaking him in an entirely different way. When he meets Levi, he feels that he has maybe found someone who can help piece him back together. The problem is that Eren is certain Levi will abandon him as soon as he learns the source of Eren's poisonous shame. Jean Kirschtein has been a police officer for years. He's trained several recruits, but there is something different about Marco Bodt. He begins to have strange feelings toward his new partner, feelings that he is ruthlessly ashamed of. One night after a few too many drinks things get a little out of hand and Jean can't even look at Marco. He has no idea how he's supposed to continue working with him."
"When Eren loses his mother to a vampire attack, he dedicates his life and soul to find the monster that killed her, hell bent on taking him out even if it kills him. Joining Erwin's little group of hunters was never a part of the plan, nor was falling for Levi of all people."
"There will always be someone that will care until the end."
"Erwin learns to love how Levi wants him."
"The world was on fire and no one could save me but you It‚Äôs strange what desire will make foolish people do I‚Äôd never dreamed that I‚Äôd love somebody like you I‚Äôd never dreamed that I‚Äôd lose somebody like you."
"Loss is hard to cope with, but there's a reason Levi is called his right hand man."
"Sometimes, it takes a strong feeling to reveal another."
"Drop me off, and don't come back."
"I see the cool, fragile look of your skin. I want to tear you, break you, and build you again."
"It's hard to breathe, sometimes. And blood gets easier to see the more you see it. You had no problems breathing, and I envy you for that, Marco."
"When her body is finally able to be placed down upon clean, white sheets, Eren cannot help the eerie thought that she looks like she has been laid to rest, the bed her coffin, the sheets her shroud."
"Despite everything, soulmates will find each other... This is a very short reincarnation story. Eren and Levi remember their past life, but both had lost hope in finding one another when their consequences caught up to them. ""When things are falling apart, they may actually be falling into place."""
"Ymir has nightmares, sometimes. They're always the same, or at least they're never very different. (Titan shifters still feel hunger. Ymir freaks out about it.) Written for a prompt on the kinkmeme: http://snkkink.dreamwidth.org/8414.html?thread=8027614#cmt8027614"

"AU. Levi hates the song, not because it's poorly written, not because it's sappy and moronic, not because the beat sucks, but because it led to a disastrous one night stand with Eren that leaves the both of them broken and angry."
"Levi loves Erwin's hands."
"After getting fired from her job, 17-year-old Ymir has no choice but to go back to school and move to the dorms. She has to share her everyday life with three other teenagers - including a certain Krista, whose fake smile intrigues her greatly. Before she knows it, she gets caught in one question: ""What's behind it?"". Yumikuri. Possibly triggering."
"Eren jaeger and Levi Ackerman their personalities couldn't be any more different. Their love shattered as their comrades die. Each loss crumbling the delicate balance that they have attained. On a expedition Levi is gravely injured and perishes. Eren is finally pushed over the edge by his death. His rage which had been precariously balanced shifted to a murderous intent slowly driving him into the hell that is insanity. In another life in another place Eren lives and so does his Levi but they are strangers. Forced apart by death brought together by love will they overcome the despair that is etched into their lives to surpass a set destiny."
"He kisses his mouth, his hands, his hair like¬†he doesn‚Äôt need to breath. They‚Äôre sensations from a life ago and don‚Äôt always make sense."
"She knew there was more to him, more for him to show her now that they were married, although no one knew, even after the few glimpses of Erwin‚Äôs weakness he had offered to her in the late hours of the night. She would find it, push him to the very limits until he cracked under the weight of his shield, bursting open for her, and she would accept each tiny piece of shrapnel that would impale her, burn at her skin. But it will hurt, burn like fire and weigh like lead over her shoulders, but how it will hurt will still be her challenge to find out, one that she feels she is following with more reckless abandon than her better judgment."
"Life has always been a ready challenger for the two of them, one that they've fought tooth and nail against to find peace of mind. So when it decides to pose another trial for the start of their family, they have no choice but resort to measures that most might think would be the simplest path. But nothing has been simple for Hange and Levi, and what may be the easiest for some may threaten to turn their life upside down, and unintentionally redefine the assumptions life holds to raising a family."
"Based on the Attack on Titan setting, integrated with elements and characters of Tokyo Ghoul, the story follows the leads of Eren and Kaneki who are facing the reality of this environment, and the consequences that come with it. Both are unique to their society, and only the two of them can amend the horrors that humanity got itself into if they can learn to get along.

"After the success of retaking Historia and Eren from the underground crystalized cavern,  saving them  from Rod Reiss, the Survey Corps set down to plan their next step. The successful mission they just went through won‚Äôt last long. They are not aware of the abyss inside Eren, who leaves them behind without a trace, off to seal his fate on his own.

"With the titans defeated and the world slowly coming to normality, Jean Kirstein is forced to start adjusting to a life without walls."
"At twenty-five years old, they meet again."
"Each night, Levi Ackerman writes a story for the end of the world. He writes of men and women who are hollowed out, dreams rotting and decaying until their bodies are nothing and their souls plummet into the earth. It is inevitable, he thinks, not morbid. It is 1938 and the world is ending."
"What do a pair of wings represent? There are many meanings, different ones for each person. Freedom perhaps? Do they both stand for two lovers, each one processing a wing? Maybe they each represent helping hands. Each with another person to say that they will help each other on the other‚Äôs journeys and when they are together, the pair will forever be together no matter where the other is. These are just a few meanings. I don‚Äôt know the true answer. No one does. Like I said, there are different meanings for each person. But the one thing they all have in common is that they are all correct."
"Eren Jaeger is a  popular 15 year old model training two up and coming models. Erwin Smith and Levi Ackerman. How will Eren deal with his developing feelings for the younger boy?

This story entails jealousy, misunderstandings, a pinning Eren and an innocently oblivious Levi."
"Some days you‚Äôre the mess and some days you‚Äôre the broom."

"Marco was in the top ten, and you, the reader, haven't even managed to get to the top twenty. So how is it that only you survived? At least for the time being..."
"It took a second to process, so unexpected was the sight. Despite the names he liked to tease her with: ‚Äúclumsy giant‚Äù and ‚Äúshit-for-vision‚Äù, in action, Hanji was as quick and graceful as they came. Shaken free, the steel grappling cable snaked past, whipping at the air. Beneath it, Hanji fell. Head knocked back and arms dangling loose at her sides, she dropped, unconscious. He didn‚Äôt think. Instincts honed sharper than a knife‚Äôs edge commanded his limbs to move. Release. Pivot. Dive."

But after a freak accident that leaves Eren and Levi shaken but otherwise seemingly unharmed, Eren starts seeing Levi's face when he isn't around, or hearing his voice when there's no way Levi could be speaking.

"Marco is a teen struggling with depressed and alcohol addiction. He comes across (Y/N) at college and that is when his life slowly starts to change. (Depressed marco x reader college au) (Don't know how long it will be)"
"‚ÄúWhat, kid? I need to take a shit.‚Äù Levi‚Äôs mouth was curled into a small half smile that meant he wasn‚Äôt nearly as annoyed by the interruption as he seemed. But Levi blinked as he fully turned to face Eren, mouth falling from that attractive half smile as Levi instead bit his bottom lip, looking Eren from top to bottom. PERMANENT HIATUS"

"They had experienced death together; something like that was bound to connect people in many ways, as if invisible bonds had been forged between them, and Levi knew there was absolutely nothing he wouldn't do today to save Eren, even if it disgusted him and left him with a crippling regret. He would never lose another friend again. He wouldn't allow himself to fail those he held close.

"With his sister (his only family) living away, being thrown out of his rundown apartment and having nowhere to go or how to support himself, Eren has no choice other than getting himself involved with a world he has never even dreamed of. Though, even after three years selling his body, things are going from bad to worst. (or, alternatively, in which Eren lives in the streets and meets an infuriating good guy along his way)"

It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ you have a beautiful smile, sir‚Äù, the boy silently stated and stuck his small brush into dark green paint, slowly and provocatively stroking the canvas in front of him, his eyes being at a steady position, refusing to move in any direction other than the green that was being smeared onto his painting. The older man refused to look anywhere but at the man that had a golden key hanging around his neck. Levi‚Äôs heart skipped a beat. ‚ÄúDo I know you‚Äù, he meant to ask, but it came out as a statement. He could see the young man flinch while painting, his hand freezing in place."
"The creaking of the floorboards and the walls. He hears them-- shuffling of the feet, whispers of the dead, through the halls, in his head. They go on like that for days, weeks, months. In the morning, the afternoon, the evening, and the night. Sometimes he wonders if he's going crazy. Other times, he doubts any of it is real at all. The lights flicker; is it him? Is it him?!"

"""This world may have failed you, it doesn't give you reason why. You could have chosen a different path in life."" It was almost as though Eren had never taken the time to think about what he was doing, or where it would get him. Somewhere? No. Nowhere? Not quite.

"Levi has a disgustingly average life. An average job. An average apartment. He takes up fighting to combat the monotony. His life definitely takes an unexpected turn when he gets caught up in an ex-fighter."
"For years, I watched humans make the same mistakes over and over. Society kept breaking apart and coming back, blinding themselves from the real cruel part of the world. I merely observed the way natural selection selected its course, because every single being was a monster. There was no one worth saving... at least that was what I thought until I met a pair of silver eyes. Or the story (because I know my summary sucks) where Eren looks like a 15 year old but is actually ancient as fuck. He finds one specific human interesting (aka Levi), so he watches over him like a goddamn stalker (not really). Eventually said human becomes his natural enemy, but Eren will still do anything for him. Because Eren knows that he can kick Levi's ass any day."
"Loving Levi was like trying to catch smoke."
"Having experienced a lot of prejudice in his childhood, Eren has build his life upon a way to never stand out.

Until the unimaginable happens, and he finds himself cast out into the forest, alone, with no place to call home. It is a cruel fate, one that leaves him unlikely to survive long. Yet Eren could never have expected to be found by a forest spirit, one of the very beings he fears above all else. Nor could he have expected the warmth and safety granted by his unlikely companion to be greater than he ever imagined..."

The cloth was pristine, as was the metal it ran over and Levi stared into the distance, eyes unfocussed and seemingly dead as he waited.

"Levi met Eren Jaeger in a crappy diner called Shiganshina. He doesn't quite remember how they fell in love, or when. He remembers when Eren got accepted into Trost U and helping him move into the dorms. He remembers long nights in his one bedroom studio apartment in Maria. He remembers Eren promising him he'd be back from Rose and visiting his family before his birthday.

"[levi x reader] You were a quiet girl, you usually avoided people, until you met one who avoided you.

"Armin has learnt what his lover is. Yet they kiss."
"- The sadness and greif he felt as he peered into the glowing eyes of the other across from him matched the fear of them disappearing in his gut. His face remained as passive as ever, but emotion boiled over internally to the point of rising acidic bile in his throat as he leaned forward and rested his head against the cold slab of the desk. ‚ÄúSleep. I‚Äôll stay.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not even real.‚Äù He stated sharply. Reaching one hand out while placing the other under his head as a cushion. ‚ÄúOf course I am. You can see me, can‚Äôt you?‚Äù"

I **am** still working on this fic, however, I have no idea how long it is going to be before I am able to get a new chapter uploaded. Sorry 32-year-old Levi Ackerman doesn't realise just how bored he really is. Jaded, stuck in a routine of work, gym, clean, oblivion and bordering on clinically depressed, to say things are a bit shitty is an understatement. 24-year-old Eren Jaeger has a problem. Fired from his job as an English Teacher after assaulting a student's father (the guy was an asshole), he just about manages to avoid jail time thanks to his lawyer (and ex-lover, also an asshole), and now he has to spend the next six months in anger management classes with some pacifist asshole looking down on him and showing him how to ""cope with things"". When Levi's asshole cat knocks a bottle of his best scotch from the roof of his apartment block, almost killing one unsuspecting Eren Jaeger, neither man realises how much of an impact it will have on both of their lives."

He's on a constant rotation of different therapies and is finally forced into a pain management group; he's been to pain management before but it was 1:1. Jean doesn't really like people too much. He's grouchy and hard to talk to as his pain slowly worsens, making it harder to really take care of himself. He has no job, lives in a shitty bed-sit, can't carry his shopping, and takes 2 painkillers a day just to attempt to minimise the effects. At this group, Jean meets a pushy but wonderfully sweet guy named Marco.

"It is something that no human could have ever thought was possible. No child's imagination, no fictional story, no written history could have prepared humanity for what had just happened. The Army Corps trainee who was just cut from the back of a 15 meter Titan's neck is someone who shook not only humanity's core, but the Survey Corps' Lance Corporal. Hopefully, they will both be able to change humankind's current morbid fate for the better. ---- It's just SNK but with more romance and focus on Levi's and Eren's difficult relationship. It will diverge from canon tho and take on it's own plot line in the future."

Searching for something that he recognized, something that would tell him who he was. He found nothing. - In which Eren is a poor baby who needs to accept himself, Levi needs to make his own choice more often, and proper communication would have helped immensely."

They're just expected to hold it together, to be prepared to go through anything. To be alright. But it's a question that Erwin can't help asking. Levi hasn't lost anyone - any of his men at least - in years. And to lose his whole squad at once, over a seemingly useless mission... Well, Erwin cares about Levi.

"""Am I really worth something to you?"" Armin nodded quietly at the question. It was true. Erwin was‚Ä¶ ridiculously handsome. He was strong, he was tall‚Ä¶ but it was more than that. He cared so deeply. He would barely show it, but Armin had spent so much time working with him.

"Humanity has been beset by monsters known as Titans for a hundred years. A seemingly endless tide of giant, humanoid devourers that managed to wipe out all life save for a lucky few, and nobody knew where they originated from, what their purpose was, and, most important, most dire, how to effectively end them once and for all. So, in desperation, these lucky few shut themselves behind three fifty meter high walls for their own protection, thinking themselves safe. Until, one day, a child is reborn. With her the sun falls and the sky soon follows. Sanctuary is breached, and in its rapture is the grim reminder that they are cattle herded into a cage. This child is named Ymir. Haunted by the memories of the boy she killed and the past life she once lived, all she remembers is the blood, tissue, and bone. All she remembers is the torment of the mindless. All she remembers is the face that haunts, the face that always reminds her of the cruelty of the world. Crimson nightmares, bringing death. The year is 845. This is the year that a girl reawakens, another fights back, and a third, a harsh mistress, is born. This is the story of those who are caged no more."
"A complete ""what-if"" retelling of Attack on Titan from the beginning if Ymir and Historia were the main characters. Starts with a rewrite of Harsh Mistress of the City spin-off light novel and continues from there. This is a story where Ymir truly kidnaps Historia to save herself, but, it's also a story where Historia is truly humanity's enemy and the most despicable girl in the world. Where there are uglier things than Titans gnawing at the roots of the world. With them the sun falls and the sky soon follows. Sanctuary is breached, and in its rapture is the grim reminder that they are cattle herded into a cage. The year is 845. This is the year that a girl reawakens, another fights back, and a third, a harsh mistress, is born. This is the story of those who are caged no more."

"A split second filled with the worst possible things that could go wrong during an expedition costs Levi his memories, and Erwin his lover."
"On that day, a part of humanity remembered the dread that was a life under the rule of tyrants‚Ä¶ The humiliation of being trapped like birds‚Ä¶ like beings that aren‚Äôt humans. Sealed by 'real' humans and forced to live on a remote island surrounded by a wall and incapable of escaping, the monsters were forced to berate each other in order to survive. Their differences had been amplified, and a huge distance had been put between Alphas, betas and omegas, with Alphas being the ones to rule, betas having to work their whole lives, and the omegas being treated like the garbage they've been taught to think they are. However, amongst those small, humiliated creatures, there was one who stood out in particular; one that decided to go against all of that, only to be hunted down, forced to bond, but escape, then hunted down again and then seek sanctuary in a common beta. And whilst Levi and Eren fight for freedom, everyone else fights for survival."
"Always. Always, always, always, as long as Armin had known Jean and Eren, they've been fighting. Why? Always fighting for no reason. It was stupid. Jean was starting to think so too. Why did they keep doing it? Armin finally realizes the reason."
"For nearly a decade, Eren had only ever experienced isolation and pain. Living on his own, he becomes accustomed to the meager life he'd managed to scrape by with, convinced that was all he'd ever make of himself. Originally he was content with this, but slowly he begins to feel the burn of a flame long forgotten begin to spike once more. Will he finally breach his shell of comfort and find enjoyment in life, or will he succumb to circumstance and allow the rekindled flame to die once more? NOTE: For anyone wondering, Levi makes his debut in chapter 13, however I would highly recommend you read the entire fic so that you have some context on how Eren has ended up at the point he's at in that specific chapter. Thanks for reading."
"Jean Kirstein is an Alpha's Alpha. He's tough and strong and a beacon, he thinks, of what all Alphas should be. Mikasa Ackerman is a gorgeous Omega who he's going to win over and bring home to his mother. Except, no. That's not how this works at all, because her little Beta friend is making eyes at him and something about this isn't quite right. Either way, Eren Jaeger is going to fucking kill him. *HIATUS*"
"Levi finds the brat all but dying in the streets on a bitter day in May. If he'd had the brains, he would have let the story end there. He doesn't."
"Levi was 8 years old when his mother got a new job and moved them to a small two bedroom basement apartment on the nicer side of town. The change was a little overwhelming, that was until he met the boy with the big ocean eyes that lived upstairs. Maybe life wouldn't be so bad after all..."

Every once in a while, he has a dream which takes place in a whole other universe. A world in which titanic-sized monster-people roam the earth; where he has close friends, enemies, lovers; in which there are some mindblowing, eerie, and frustratingly out-of-reach circumstances; in which people get murdered, commit suicide, or simply... go missing. Basically, Eren gets a dream where someone dies, and then within the next week, that person dies. *GUYS IT'S BETTER THAN THE SUMMARY SAYS IT IS I PROMISE!!* On hiatus"
"The porn industry in a world of Alpha, Betas, and Omegas has its perks and quirks. Levi, an Alpha, works on screen as one of the stars for SnX, and Eren, as assistant to the director, gets the pleasure of working in a world of raging pheromones and an Alpha that continues to set his heart ablaze."
"There‚Äôs a certain breaking point in every relationship, Eren mused. Some reach it. Some don‚Äôt. His did, and that was that. Alternatively: the one where they realize that not every ending is a happy one."

Then comes Fukawa and her story. And so on and so on, untill all stories from the day the wall fell are told. This is the part of the series ""Attack on Dangan"" in which all characters are rooted up from the Dangan Ronpa/SDR2 story line, and put in the Attack on Titan universe, as if they had lived there their whole lives."
"Jean has a habit of falling for people too easily and Eren, not enough."
"Levi wasn't sure how long he'd been asleep when he was torn from the endless darkness of his mind by a deep, disturbing groan. Eren's body jerked roughly, his nails digging painfully into Levi's upper arm. Levi was disoriented for a moment as he sat up, unsure of what was happening. Eren dug his fingers in harder, a sob caught in his throat as he begged ‚Äì ""Please don't go."""

"Marco wakes up three months before the Attack on Trost and tries to change the course of history. Marco knows there are two possibilities: first ‚Äì he's somehow gone back in time and Reiner, Bertholdt and probably Annie are titans, and second ‚Äì he's gone insane. He's inclined to believe the latter, but he remembers all too clearly the feeling of Reiner's hand covering his mouth, he remembers Annie taking off his gear, he remembers the titan's teeth. There isn't a night he doesn't dream of those teeth."
"Levi is not like the others, but that's okay, because so are you. Expected to present as an alpha, you grow up with the boy that is expected to present as an omega, but life is not fair and problems arise oh so very easily. But you're both not what your parents thought you to be, and the tension between the two of you is easily ignored in favour of an relationship that has an end tied to a clock that is ticking down. Because alphas don't waste their times with betas after they meet their omega bondmates. It's an unspoken rule as old as the first tales."
"Historia had never meant to tell Ymir her birthday."
"Such thoughts are always in his mind, as it never seems to get rid of her. The walk he's taking in the corridors has been long, his candle is at the point of extinction, but he doesn't care.

"Eren is clinically depressed: he had been abused by his father as a child after his mother had passed away. He had no one to turn to in regards to family, and instead chose to run away, abandoning his friends and cutting bonds with his father. Fast forward to today, where he‚Äôs being taken care of by his friend, Armin, and has never recovered from all those years of scars inflicted onto him physically and engraved into his mind mentally. It‚Äôs up to him to seek help from a therapist. And he does, from a certain Dr Levi Ackerman."

They would also have an unlimited army of controllable Titans to unleash upon their enemies. Rayne Lee, however, was a true loyal Eldian, like her father and his father before. She also had another mission, a mission given to her by the Founding Titan herself, a mission given in fear and desperation in the final moments of life.

That's all an Ackerman was good for, anyways, according to my Uncle. Lying and fighting. Then he came into my life. The type of man ballads are written about.

"There's never a good night in this place. It's usually always the same. The people may seem different on the outside, but deep down they're the same disgusting monsters, like it's embedded in their bones. My routine: think about it, get fucked, think about it, get paid, think about it, wash up, think about it, get fucked. I'm just as vile as the people I'm with. I'm no good. I'm no angel. I'm just a normal, awful, person. STATUS: Hiatus. (Might be dropped)"
"Armin is weightless flight of loyalty, tenderness, light. Eren is a pure drive of energy, brightness, innocence. First is the standard of elegance, second - of courage. And one day the elegance will bend to the courage, will allow it to break the wings, will humbly shut up in tightening bonds. AU in which Eren changes the nature of Armin."
"For months Erwin allowed himself to truly care for someone, opening himself up to the very real possibility of an unhealable heartbreak from a swift, untimely death.  And Levi thinks it‚Äôs a game."
"‚ÄúW-what are you doing here?‚Äù Levi eyed him up and down, with what felt like the most judgmental stare he‚Äôd ever received, before non-chalantly waving his hand. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it obvious?‚Äù He asked. Eren shook his head. He had no idea what the hell was going on. Which was pretty normal for him actually‚Äîbut today, it just felt like one big, cruel, joke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to coach you Jaeger‚Äîor better yet, I‚Äôm here to help you win a gold medal in next year‚Äôs Grand Prix Final.‚Äù Or basically, the AOT/YOI crossover I desperately need"

"Eren was a normal kid with a normal childhood, a sick mother, and a father he never really knew. He had his goals set and was attending a well-known law school when his life suddenly turned upside down. His father had apparently researched illegal things no one ever bothered to explain before he had been found dead in his own laboratory and without the supposed experiments. So Eren had to return. His life that had been harsh, but perfect, was falling apart once he got home, going from a highly-ranked law student to a mere guy with multiple jobs to bring food to the table and having to take care for his mother whose health was deteriorating. Ever since then, things were... normal. Plain. One year later, when Eren thought it was finally over, a group of people decided to turn up in the coffee shop he worked at. And one raven-haired detective thought it would be a good idea to hire him to be his assistent in the search of the very crime Eren had tried to forget. And Eren, feeling wrapped around his little finger, couldn't really say 'no'."

"The first time I met you, you were laughing. And after that first time, it was a rare occasion you couldn‚Äôt find something to laugh about, no matter the circumstances. You were the one holding all of us up, finding those silver linings in everything, the jokes in even the most dire of situations. I was so busy shaking my head, calling you crazy while I hid my own grins, I didn‚Äôt realize there was no one holding you up. The ones who laugh the loudest are the ones in the most pain or so they say. I never was a very good listener."
"Time has stopped for Levi, life ceased to move completely. He's been stuck in a moment ever since the tragic night. Frozen. And then one day, his eyes meet bright green and his world starts anew. His heart gets a sudden jolt and time begins to move once again. But does Levi remember what it means to truly live or is it too late to melt his cold heart? Is it frozen? Or maybe it's broken beyond hope?"

"It was the biggest decision Levi had to make. (Written for Eruri Week Day 1: Titanwin)"
"""Is it ever not just like that?"" Jean asked. His voice was rye and hard. It made Armin flinch. ""You pull a trigger, Armin. You press a fucking button. You don't even need to be touching them.

"Levi suffers because of his depression. Eren suffers because Levi suffers."
"The night before Trost is attacked by the Colossal Titan, Marco's acting pretty strange, like he's expecting something bad to happen.

It's not until over a month later that he finds out why Marco was acting so weird."

"‚ÄúI'm not strange, weird, off, nor crazy, my reality is just different from yours.‚Äù-- Cheshire Cat If someone told you that Alice in Wonderland was a true story, you would probably laugh.

All I cared about was her, my hands lifting of their own accord to tangle in her black hair. But then a flash of gold eyes and an all too familiar devilish smile flashes across my mind, instantly causing me to pull back as if I had been burnt. Mikasa stares at me, her eyebrows furrowed. She looks both content with our kiss and yet hurt that I had snatched myself from her, and I didn't know what to say to ease her mind. I definitely couldn't say that I had been thinking of Reiner of all people when I pulled away... Why...did life have to be so hard."

"Erwin is the flashiest man Levi‚Äôs ever met. It annoys the shit out of him. In Erwin‚Äôs defense, it technically isn‚Äôt his fault that he‚Äôs a handsome son of a bitch. What is his fault, however, is how he knows he looks like Greek god, and uses it to his advantage. His slicked-back blond hair, suave jokes, and winning smile make all the ladies swoon. Levi only knows because they make him swoon too, although he'd rather choke to death before admitting that. So yeah, it annoys the shit out of Levi. It doesn‚Äôt help that they‚Äôre best friends slash roommates, and Levi has to idly sit by the sidelines as Erwin goes through woman after woman."

"I couldn‚Äôt tell you how it started. I‚Äôve gone over it so many times in my head and I assume the best place to start is the beginning. I was twenty-three, and late for work.

For some reason that day though, I was and it changed my life forever."
"Amongst dead eyes attached to dead expressions attached to dead bodies, Levi meets Eren, a shining ray of hope in a hopeless war. A story about finding the will to live and dealing with loss. And probably other things because I don't know what I'm going to do with this. I suck at summaries."

He‚Äôs also highly aware that blackmailing a French general into serving underneath him, hiding a Jewish prisoner in a secret room of his home, and adopting three children‚Äîone of which shouldn‚Äôt technically be alive‚Äîis likely to get him executed on the spot. Then again, Erwin‚Äôs never been one to show his emotions, so whether or not his situation frightens him in the least is a different question altogether."

Life is a little tough, because you have one brother who is head of a massive gang and another who is Captain of police and you're just a writer.

Erwin smiled, a split-lipped wince. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a scumbag.‚Äù Mike made a face, grimaced, brought his glass to his lips. ‚ÄúYeah, actually,‚Äù he laughed. Erwin sighed and sat back, wooden chair resilient against the strain of him and all his woes. ‚ÄúProbably,‚Äù he agreed."
"Eren probably should have thought about the fact that he's a terrible dancer before agreeing to dance with Mikasa at her wedding in place of their deceased father. Luckily, Levi is the king of the ballroom and Eren is the king of persistence. Unluckily, Eren can't stop blushing long enough to actually learn how to not step on his dancing partner's feet. --- Eren also had been harboring a huge crush on the man for three years, but he had learned to treat it as one of those unfortunate things in life that you have no control over. Like, oh, I got a papercut. Oh, someone scratched my car in the parking lot. Oh, I‚Äôm in love with Levi Ackerman."
"I took a look behind me to see my house one last time before I fell. I tried to memorize the colour of the slate shingles on my roof, the stained glass windows that were filled with separate memories of their own, memories of my mother and I finding the glass at markets and bringing them home to painstakingly attach them to pieces of metal, then we would paint the tiniest details onto the colourful glass. After that we would spend a day taking out the plain glass windows and putting in the new beautiful windows. I felt tears gathering at the corners of my eyes as something hit me.

They were the happiest couple anyone had ever seen and were so in tune with each other. Their friends would often tease them about it, but they would just brush it off. Sure, they had their disagreements every now and then, every couple does but they would always reconcile with each other the day after. It‚Äôs hard to stay mad at someone you wish to live the rest of your life with. Unfortunately, their happy days together ended when Levi who was on his way home after going grocery shopping, got hit by a truck that was out of control."

Yet, despite your best efforts, you've lost many close friends and comrades. With Eren's emergence as a titan, you're both confused and hopeful, for once believing that you might survive this war of attrition. However, the continued losses and deaths chip away at your fading optimism and hope in a future for humans. Yet, unwilling to give up on that hope, you find comfort in the form of the least comforting person you know. Follows a part of the progression of the manga/anime, so there will be spoilers! I'm not quite sure how much of the plot progression I'll include, so to be safe if you haven't watched to the end of the first season of Attack on Titan (the anime)/up to chapter 51 of the manga, there will be spoilers!"
"He should have known. Really."
"Eren and Levi share a secret about Mikasa's past. Mikasa confesses her feelings to Eren, only to be rejected. After watching her almost die, Eren realizes he has feelings for her, but she has already moved on to Levilandia. ""I thought they hated each other"" Before losing hope he thinks that maybe... if he tells Mikasa who the captain really is... he might have a chance, or fuck it up? Is the Ackerman bond stronger than a lifetime of memories together? Jelousy, drama, a shared secret, and Titans, what could possibly go wrong?"
"Okay so like I think Bertolt deserves better so I‚Äôm gunna write my own sappy version of the events in AOT I plan *cross fingers* to write up until where the anime ended and then continue with season 4. It‚Äôll be a bit of a slow start before the Bertolt/reader stuff gets exclusive but tbh that‚Äôs the way the sweet boy is yknow. Also there‚Äôs a slight eren x reader vibe because frankly I wanted it there since Eren is also a cutie ;> But yeah this is a retelling of the events in AOT except you‚Äôre there and also you have the hots for the tall cry baby Man bc ofc u do. Also reader is going to be mixed race or you could imagine them as purely Caucasian like the rest (minus mikasa) I just wanted to include that for myself since I wanted to write a future side plot concerning Mc‚Äôs parents as I want one of them to be hinted as being another ethnicity but I won‚Äôt state which one it is so yall can relate more too :)"

At the prompting of his therapist, he decided to open a pottery store and teach classes as a way to change gears and turn his hobby into a career. Not everyone in his life fully understood his change of heart, but he doesn't mind, because above all else, he is happy for the first time in a long time.

"There were two reasons she wore a mask. One, because she was the vigilante of the underground, killing those who do wrong. Two, if people found out who she truly was, she would be hunted down. She thought her life would always stay the same, until one day the Survey Corps decide they want her to fight against the titans.

"Reiner and Armin are not handling the present (or the past for that matter) well."
"Eren lived a fairly peaceful life playing around with Armin and having parents that loved him with all their hearts. He was happy, and he was, like most kids, spoiled and a brat at times. But, in the end, he was happy. Little Eren Yeager just did not know how much he would long for those days - even the bad ones, after a fatidical night where he turned into a monster. And he learned to live with his new titanic body, regulating his strength and being careful with his movements so he wouldn't hurt anybody, because he would not let himself turn even more into the monster he had became. But he simply was a naive kid and he chose to ignore what was soon to come. Of course his family wouldn't be able to keep him a secret forever; someone would discover it soon enough. And so, the nine-year-old had to face what was to come, now, all by himself. He wouldn't have a father to guide him and remember him how strong he was and how careful he needed to be. He wouldn't have his friends to lift his mood when he was in a bad day or when he was feeling lonely. And he also wouldn't have his mother to hug when he felt desperate and like he couldn't do it anymore. He was, truly, alone."

Tears stroked down his eyes to his chin, and his breathing was shallow. He started chocking and he was almost sure that his sobs could be heard from all the hospital floor. He buried his face into Erwin‚Äôs arm, inhaling deeply the familiar scene."

You're his daughter, and with that, he would put his life on the line just to save yours over the others. His life-long goal of proving his deceased father's theories and him having to raise you seemed to be something impossible to him, but he vowed to be the best father that could ever be, just for you. Several years later went by. He had returned from a 'secret mission', so he calls them, from the underground. After returning with three thugs, you noticed their strange behavior and strange late-night meet-ups. You knew instantly something was off, and they were not to be trusted. Still though, there was something about one of the three. Levi was his name, apparently."

They are all excellent detectives, handpicked by humanity's so-called strongest one; Levi Ackerman, and no crime will go unsolved or unjustified in their hands. Everything seems to be going well until a new member joins in. His name is Oluo Bozado, and he seems nice enough. He was picked by Captain Levi himself, so he must be trustworthy, right?"

"Surviving within the walls had unwillingly kicked her to the tight grip of the Survey Corps. There, she will be pushed to the limits, always under the apathetic controlling scrutinizing eyes of Captain Levi. Who finds her to be nothing more than a nuisance and a waste of time to even serve a purpose to humanity. Sianna on the other hand wants nothing more than to serve her own selfish needs and be the one to get her payback on the Captain and those who forced her to join  a suicidal life mission. Hopefully she will not lose her route to her objective nor either is the Captain going to lose sight of his morals and goals. HIATUS - Going for a revision and rewrite a few things.

"Open any early modern history book and you'll find stories of the witch trials, whether it be in Europe, the Americas or Asia. Women were slaughtered by the thousands after being accused of witchcraft, despite there being no way to prove that was the case. Some of them had been midwives, some were blamed for bad harvests, others were targeted simply because they were considered 'ugly' by the men in that particular village. None of the real witches were ever caught, they were far too cunning to be reprimanded by mere mortals. They hid in the shadows and eventually assimilated, right under the noses of the very men who had spent decades persecuting them. Now they live amongst the modern population, practicing in secret. Artemis Reader thinks her heritage is a curse and wants nothing more than to truly be a 'normal' modern woman, but when her Coven is targeted by an ancient organisation she has no choice but to fight for her right to exist."

"Because ordinary meant a pen in his hand and his head in the other, paperwork slowly worked through as time bled by. It meant periods of silence that served as a reminder as to how fleeting amity could be, the lack of noise almost taunting in his office. It meant crisp sheets and neatly-arranged pillows, not because he insisted on doing his bed every morning (although it wouldn‚Äôt be entirely out of his character to do so), but because he simply never used it. Ordinary always meant his bed felt too big, too cold, too empty when he was alone. But never before had ordinary meant laying beside you, realising that you had fallen asleep and wondering, as he quietly admired you, what he ever did to deserve this. Ordinary never meant letting those brief touches from before become anything more, but here he was, acting on a feeling he couldn‚Äôt quite explain as he slowly shifts nearer to you and wraps an arm around your waist, careful not to wake you as he pulls you closer and letting himself, just this once, keep you close to him. ‚Äî or, alternatively, in which you return to the military as an engineer where bullets are shot, tea is made and bruises are earned"

She quickly finds herself in a love/ lust triangle with Mike Zacharias and Erwin Smith. There is just something about the reader that the latter can't ignore, is it the fact that she's an enigma or that she's a though nut to crack. The story will have a lot of smut, action, angst and there will be some TWs throughout the whole story."

""Sorry,"" she mumbled, shuffling and adjusting the restraints her hands were in. The clanking of the chains echoed through the hall and she hissed once a piece of the metal caught and pinched her skin. Historia looked down at her from beside the judge apologetically, pouting slightly as she saw Ymir chained to the ground. Typically the monarch didn't take part in trial cases and only passes judgement once the trial had concluded but Historia had requested to supervise this time. ""Sorry, why are we doing this again?"" Ymir asked, already done with it. ============================ What would have happened if Ymir had never left? What if no one died?

"I‚Äôm going to die. The breath was knocked out of her as she collided with one of the trees. She gasped for air as she slid down the trunk. Chunks of metal had embedded themselves in her arm. Her blades had shattered when they hit the tree, and the shrapnel had cut into her skin. Attempting to activate her ODM gear, tears started to fall down her face. No gas. This was it. This was how she was going to die. Alone. Black spots danced in her vision. She probably had a concussion. A laugh escaped her lips.

"Laying with you by the sea, Jean Kirschtein isn‚Äôt quite sure why he‚Äôs remembering your expression from all those years ago. That small upturned grin that he earned as you both laid in the crimson foliage, staring at one another‚Äôs faces. He isn‚Äôt sure why your teenage face is burned into his mind, earning a harsh embrace from his heart. He recalls the curve of your face, the impression of the sunset on your complexion, your blood-stained cheeks, the way your eyes crinkled as you cried, the way you spoke his name. Perhaps it‚Äôs because all of those years ago, he finally saw you for the soul that you wished Eren would see you as. The benevolence of your heart finally becoming clear after getting that same heart demolished in the blink of an eye. Or maybe it‚Äôs because he loves you more endearingly and wholeheartedly than he ever loved Mikasa Ackerman. And it isn‚Äôt only this moment. Jean Kirschtein relives each and every moment with you."
"It hurts. It hurts for Jean to look at Eren. For Jean to see Eren become everything he used to despise. He wishes he could just go back in time. To save Eren before this monster was created. Was there ever a point in time in which he could have prevented this? Was Eren ever savable?"
"Instead of thinking up new ways to fight against the titans, everyone was wrapped up in the so-called 'scandal' of Eren and Armin's relationship. But not in a good way. Unfortunately for them, the news of them being gay wasn't taken as well by everyone else as it was by their friends."

Your eyes slowly trailed up to the walls in the not-so-far distance, which were as still as usual, before looking up at the sky above. Something wasn't right. And, finally, the clovers before you swayed once again. Like a great tremor awoke them. Just like that, the little trance you were in broke.

Neither had anything better to do and even if they tried, nothing would chase the image of their hurt friend away. Eren gently grabbed the side of Mikasa‚Äôs face to bring their foreheads together.

If he has any regrets, it‚Äôs probably that the only kiss they shared was like this, thanks to the CPR, but it‚Äôs not a regret in itself, because dying in Mikasa's arms is the most pleasant thing. He thought that it would not happen, that when he died, it would be by the hand of Levi, or even Zeke, but he always thought he would disappear. Either deep in the earth or in his head, but disappear at last. He thought that he would not rest and, honestly, he was okay with that. Series: Canon!verse side stories [1]"

So, the two spoke with her bedroom door separating them, unsure what either looked and only knowing the ins and outs of their voice. That was until Levi left one day, leaving her to question everything and wondering why he'd abandoned her. And her questions are answered fifteen years later, when she's forced to fight him in the Reiss' Chapel as part of the Anti-Personnel Control Squad, and she may be in for more than she'd bargained for. Because she never expected to fall for him. And he never expected to fall for her."

"Some people believe in past lives. There are theories defending the existence of alternative universes, past lives or soulmates. A D√©j√† vu is sometimes explained as a memory of our past self, some people even claim they can actually remember clearly how they were and what they did back then. That was the case of a special family. The Ackermans had that gift -or curse. Titans, walls, death, the Survey Corps... Levi could remember everything about it. Therefore, when he met a certain man again, he couldn't help but get anxious. Perhaps, they finally had an opportunity to live happily. After all, soulmates were meant to be together."
"Having a cushy library job at the royal palace sounds like a blessing.  Except for the fact that you and your mother's life depends on it, and you don‚Äôt know how to read. A historical palace AU where (y/n) is put in a tough situation."

"The man seated on the back of the horse tightened his jaw, teeth grating together uncomfortably. He had no desire to remain here a moment longer, and yet, something told him to stay. Perhaps it was the pitiful sight of that unfortunate soul on the stand. Perhaps it was the future that took so little imagination to conjure up of what would happen to her if that foul individual won the auction, which judging by the extravagant gold pocket watch cradled in his pudgy fingers, he would. Perhaps it was some other reason. Regardless of root of the motive, he inhaled and called, ‚ÄúFive hundred.‚Äù ~~~ An AU in which Levi is a wealthy lord, passing through town one day when he sees a slave being sold at auction.

I can‚Äôt train.‚Äù Levi frowned. ‚ÄúWell why the hell not?‚Äù He asked, irritated. ‚ÄúBecause. Levi,‚Äù She addressed him, and Levi knew this was serious. She only called him by his first name during very personal matters. He looked at her expectantly, waiting for her to continue. After taking a deep breath, she did. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pregnant. And it‚Äôs yours.‚Äù Levi gets Petra pregnant. Together, they have to decide what to do about it."
"When I remember the past with her... Without realizing it, she disappears... Maybe, she didn't even exist... I'm searching for something that I can't reach... The moment our eyes met, she became the only constant in my life.  I'm always fooling myself with her long black hair that with every touch seems farther away from me, with that smile she gives me before doing something foolish that we'll probably both regret the next day.  I became addicted to it the same way a smoker is addicted to nicotine.  I became dependent on Mikasa Ackerman. My ghost, where'd you go? I wish you were with me forever but you couldn't ‚Ä¶. I know ghosts don't haunt forever. Inspired in the song ""Ghost"" by Halsey."

On his end, Levi's no longer sure whether he wants to be by Erwin's side anymore. He fell in love with the picture-perfect Commander, but can he love Erwin, the man with a dream and a broken heart?"
"‚ÄúYour truth is your own. Find it and follow it.‚Äù These were the last words your father spoke, but you had not been able to make sense of them. Until now. Your eyes shine with a spark of excitement that mixes with the reflecting explosion from an upper level room of HQ. Cerulean blue swirls with warm orange and smokey grey. Panicked screams break out all around you as a bloody, smouldering corpse lands not far from your feet. People begin to jostle you, moving away from the disaster, but you remain still. Grounded. A smile slowly spreads over your lips as you watch the flames grow. It is in this moment that everything fits together. Eren Yeager is your truth."

"The first dream Levi ever remembered happened when he was five. The screaming, the blood‚Äîmonsters eating people, and Levi was flying through the trees, searching: there was someone that Levi knew only he was strong enough to protect as he flew through the air, searching for him, whoever he was, as the branches flew past and the wind whipped through his cloak. When he woke up screaming and in tears in the arms of his mother, he didn‚Äôt understand. She cooed to him, running her fingers through his hair and she told him it was just a nightmare, lifting him into her arms and carrying him to their small kitchen to make him a cup of tea."

He has to find a muse for his new novel so he can become one of the greatest authors the world has ever seen in the largest city in France and with no language skills, no friends, and only 20 days till his first rough draft is due to his editor, it would take a miracle for him to make the deadline in time. But everyone knows miracles don't exist outside of fiction. That's what makes them so exhilarating to write."
"An accident, and Levi knows the victim. He grew up with him. He laughed with him, cried with him, loved him. He drifted apart from him. And it figures. It fucking figures that he's probably going to lose him. - Levi and Erwin's lives before they became distant, and their lives when they meet again."

His mother was trying to fix his hair, desperately taming the unruly ash blonde strands as they stubbornly stayed tussled, muttering in exasperation all the while. The boy himself was trying to swat her hands away, a deep frown on his face and his cheeks puffed out in indignation. When she had finally decided it was good enough, she turned to you and your mother, standing nearby in the market, and gave you both a smile."

"In the afternoon, the kids arrive after school and fill the shop with their warmth; Gabi's constant chatter and Falco's quiet murmuring. Levi sits in the corner by the window overlooking the bay and sips his tea."
"He saw love in different forms. He saw love between mothers and their children as they used water to wipe dirt off their cheeks. He saw love between comrades who hugged after a certain battle. He saw love between two people who‚Äôs worlds revolved around the other. Eren and Armin are examples of that, he thought."
"Hange reuniting with their loved ones post chapter 132."
"There was the thought of asking him again sometime, hearing Armin‚Äôs answer now. Would he still look at Jean with that same hope in his eyes? Would he still talk about all the books he wanted to write, and all the histories he wanted to know? The things he maybe still wanted to see. Jean wondered, but a part of him knew he‚Äôd be too afraid to ask, too scared to see that the light had gone out completely, and even the mere question wouldn‚Äôt be enough to bring it back."
"Levi had never really imagined getting married.  Not until Eren, at least. Eren's family bookstore was on the corner. Levi fell in love with the candles, the shelves, the windows, and the chipping paint.  One summer, he fell in love with the owner's son, Eren.

"He shouldn‚Äôt be doing this. It will only hurt Armin more when he inevitably leaves. It‚Äôs not fair to Armin, touching him like nothing is wrong. But Eren does it anyway. pwp / a few nights before Eren goes missing in Marley"
"It happened so quickly - he was driving away from home after a heated argument with his manipulative mother, he was out of his mind, he was angry, sad, and upset... and he hit Marco. He hit his previous classmate, his friend, the guy who could understand his family issues. Yeah, Reiner broke his nose, fractured some of his ribs, and had a couple of bruises and abrasions on his sides , but his raven-haired friend pulled the shorter end of the stick: he almost went half-blind, he had several broken bones, and after his long and painful stay in the hospital he catched a really bad respiratory infection. Could he ever forgive Reiner? Or the better question: could Reiner ever forgive himself?"
"'You liars! Fucking bastards. You lied to me all my life. I hate you. I hate you so much. Don‚Äôt ever call me your son again!' He clutched his hair as the image of Hange's wet cheeks and a burning handprint left by Levi on the left cheek appeared right in front of his eyes. He felt as if there was an endless pit right in his gut, in the place his mother used to kiss and rub when he got bloated as a child. No They deserved it. They lied to me all this time."

"Eren had eyes following him since he was twelve years old. At first, it terrified him. Someone was watching him, stalking him. Eventually the fear grew familiar, and almost fond. The goosebumps turned into anticipation. The heavy weight of the stare used to feel oppressive. Now it just feels like love."
"Punished for his cold attitude, Levi is sent to the human world by his superior Erwin. In order to not scare the humans because he is a demon, Levi has to wonder around the human world for a month as a black cat. Humans and Demons are aware of each other and want to connect, but Demons are so socially awkward or excited that humans are scared. Levi isn't keen on the humans, but when he's over there he meets a sweet kind woman, you. At first he rejects you, he eventually goes home with you. Not knowing Levi is a demon, he lives with you and sees how broken you are. With a manipulative and selfish best friend around you, as well as a creepy landlord spying on you, Levi is determined to fix it all, because you are deeply a good person.

"Hange Zoe supposes that all great interrogations start with torture rather than lead up to it‚Äîafter all, the direct introduction to pain is one of the best deterrents of dissidence, and theoretically if one were weak enough to fess up quickly, they‚Äôd do so immediately at the sight of such frightening tools as nail pliers and bone saws. It saves time, and in the case that the informant turned out to have more of a steely resolve than expected, then torture would do nothing but weaken said resolve. It‚Äôs a win-win either way."
"Levi saw Erwin through a computer screen, where sand and sun had kissed his flesh, stained his cheeks and neck. He looked so beautiful like that, even though he was on the other side of the world fighting a war that Levi didn‚Äôt believe in. But he believed in Erwin, always had. The man had these visions of grandeur, this idea that he owed someone something, this unrelenting sense of devotion that he would burn himself down for. There wasn‚Äôt much Levi put his faith in: he worshipped no god, prayed no prayers, didn‚Äôt wish on shooting stars nor copper coins tossed to water fountains. But he believed in Erwin with a force he couldn‚Äôt yield or contain. Wherever those blue eyes looked, Levi would look also. So when Erwin whispered in his ear before stepping onto that plane, bidding his husband goodbye, saying ‚ÄòI‚Äôll come home to you, my love‚Äô, Levi took it as more than a promise. He took it as gospel; written in stone and blood and cosmic stardust. I‚Äôll come home to you, my love."
"Levi lays Erwin to rest"
"When Armin gets word of Eren‚Äôs location, he takes off to go find him. Never mind a thought-out plan‚Äîthey need to talk, and they need to do it now. Eren‚Äôs expecting him. He‚Äôs uninterested in just talking."
"hange learned long ago they are not good at this sort of thing. who needs to speak of emotion when you can simply drag someone down to the corner shop, kicking up dirt in your combined wake, and buy them an ice cream which you‚Äôll then steal a lick from? it‚Äôs been ages since they‚Äôve as much as seen an ice cream and they‚Äôre beginning to think they‚Äôll need to start getting creative. ; or, the author is sad and projecting onto hange through an attempt at a found family fic :]"

Will she be able to save them all, especially Levi, who tends to end up dead again and again? Can she face her true feelings for a certain friend?"
"The kid‚Äôs got lice. Well, Kenny guesses he shouldn‚Äôt be surprised.  Comin‚Äô from that fuckin‚Äô shit-ass, rat infested hellhole Kuchel‚Äôd given herself over to, ‚Äòcourse the kid had lice.  Probably had a whole buncha‚Äô other shit wrong with him too.  No doubt. // Kenny takes Levi home."
"It was in rare moments like this that Eren was aware of how much his admiration for the famous Captain Levi had morphed into something more. His respect for the older man had never quivered, not even when he got to know the real him, his short temper and unfiltered words, but something else had. What had started like a small sparkle lit during his daydreams of joining the Survey Corps, when Levi was still only his idol, had now turned into a full fire, burning brighter the more time he spent under Levi‚Äôs mentorship."
"Mikasa had always found it astonishing how a photograph could capture a single moment. And Eren agreed, because he wanted Mikasa to have something that reminded her of him."
"The only hue that stained his monochrome world - Red. The colour was everywhere.  Red blemishing those slender digits of his, red flowing in gutters, red was the water in which he bathed, red was the colour he couldn't escape. Titans- this was a very well-known name in Trost City , every single person wished they wouldn't ever encounter it. Who wouldn't? Titans were a ruthless group killing anyone that ever crossed paths with them. Their leader , Kenny Ackerman , a sadistic bastard who did not want his autocracy over Trost to end. He nourished on the fear of others. Even the cops feared him. And Of Course, not to forget his right hand without whom Kenny was nothing, Levi Ackerman. Another infamous group, but less cruel than The Titans was - Survey Corps. The rivalry between these two groups was very well heard of, could also result in deaths of many innocents. Eren Yeager, member of Survey Corps who swore he would avenge his mother's death. His sole purpose was to kill Kenny Ackerman who dared to pierce his mother's skull with the filthy bullet of his gun. What will happen when the two rivals meet? Will Eren be able to pull off that blindfold of revenge and be able to see affection in Levi's eyes?"
"perhaps;"
"He was what home meant to her: a vision of spending an eternal summer slacking, sleeping in the meadows, watching the sky. Home was a world meant just for the two of them. A world like today."
"""He who wears the crown shall become king. The crown may fall, but the king is still king."" - There‚Äôs a big difference between acting and lying, Levi thinks. To act, you must be skilled, calculated, and fully portray the role you‚Äôre given. To lie, all you have to do is leave things out. Ignore the truth. Add syllables to your daily speech and hope it deceives the person in front of you. Pray your cards don‚Äôt fumble when it‚Äôs time to play. But Levi knows this all too well. He is an actor after all. And Levi lies, but acting is far easier. And lying is far worse. - Inspired by Mitski's 'Liquid Smooth'."

But Eren can't ignore Jean once he witnesses something disturbing happening in the Kirstein house. After that, all Eren wants to do in the world is be there for Jean."
"I guess I can say I‚Äôve never truly believed in ghosts. It was more of an acceptance. A sort of understanding that the shadows that lurked around the dustiest corners of my room weren‚Äôt just passing cars or mice skittering across the floorboards. I understood that there was something there, but I kind of just let it be. I should introduce myself. My name is Jean Kirschstein, and  my life just got a bit more complicated. Jean's had a pretty boring life. He's working off the expenses of moving out of the shithole known as Shiganshina.

"Titans. They were gigantic droids that were created for the sole purpose to be man kind's body guards, however, a virus infiltrated corrupting their data base, leading to man's kind's bleak fate. Levi is an droid built for one purpose. Eliminate the titans. The scouting legion's scientists could only have dreamed of creating such a perfect model, and now that he was finally built, hope arose. There were some some restrictions Levi had to follow in order to be kept in full function. He couldn't become close friends with any of his comrades, he couldn't be excepted into any family, and above all, he couldn't fall in love. Should he have broken anyone one of those, his system would be shut down. The scouting legion realized one droid couldn't handle such an enormous task in his metallic hands. Thus, droid Eren Jeager was created, along with a whirlwind of trouble."

He wanted to bring his own peace to an unknown place and hide there, but his own peace has passed away. His own peace has gone to a place, where he was not only his own peace anymore, and his peace also faded away with Levi‚Äôs shadow. His own peace has gone, so Erwin‚Äôs heart was shaking again."

The third blink was shorter than the rest, as if he was coming to a quick resolution.

Over and over again she saved him, but during the most pivotal moment, when it really mattered, she failed. Not even that, but it was her blade that caused him to meet his end. (Beheading - what a way to repay someone for saving your life.) (post-canon angst)"

"He didn't know what he was doing at her door step in the middle of the night. He didn't know what he expected when she opened the door. All he knew is that he had to have her, like a starved man roaming the desert. He wanted that soft look at the sunset be the same when she looked at him. Levi knew he this was insanity, and he is willingly going crazy."
"Jean knew better than to read Pieck‚Äôs journal while she was in the shower. She was preparing herself for their New Year‚Äôs Eve party. Their friends would all be coming over to celebrate as they always have. Jean couldn't stop himself from running his fingers over the soft paper pages of the leather bound journal that Pieck brought everywhere she went. He couldn‚Äôt help but read the words that she had written in black ink. Most entries were inconsequential, simply written about the job that Pieck hated and wanted nothing more than to be freed of. He wished he had stopped then and there. Jean wished he had chosen to mind his own business and didn‚Äôt flip to her most recent entry and read those words."

"Armin wakes up to the sensation of agony. What, or who happened and why? He is pretty sure he's been assaulted in his own home. However, there is no sign of any culprit."

"Historia gasps, struggling to think past the carnal hunger burning through her veins. Ymir‚Äôs moist tongue traces circles on her lower abdomen, her head slowly dipping down. ‚ÄúHow may I please you, my queen?‚Äù Ymir purrs, rubbing her cheek against Historia‚Äôs soft inner thighs."
"What you were: prepared to join the Military Police, as per Lord Reiss's instructions. Your mind was sharp, your body trained, and your will resigned. What you were not: prepared to meet Eren Jaeger. He was a lightning strike in a summer storm sort of boy, the kind that was brilliantly there and then gone in a flash, leaving spots in your vision. What you would never be: prepared to love Eren Jaeger. He took your breath away, that beautiful boy with his never-broken oaths. You always found each other, in every life you lead. He had promised as much, after all, in another universe, another time - and he never broke his promises. What neither of you realized was that you always lost each other, too - and this time was no different."
"Even when everything was over, haunting images of what happened were deeply engraved inside Erwin's soul, haunting him, whenever he tried to sleep. The one coming to him tonight was especially bad, but just like there, Levi is there to lead the way."

"It was a time when people desired to murder the most, yet no longer hired assassins. An age of backstabbing and lawsuits with radiant smiles. A time where progress rolled on well-oiled cogs but going backwards. Intellectuals teemed about like pigeons around old bits of bread, yet the world had plunged into absolute idiocy. Warmth felt cold and cold felt like piping hot apple pies fresh off the oven. And Levi Ackerman was an unemployed ex-assassin who hadn‚Äôt done a single hit in seven years and was quickly running out of money to pay for the rent of his shitty flat with the meagre money he got from his odd jobs. He was good at virtually all kinds of manual work. And he was especially good at cleaning."

Jean hid his emotions well, but after Eren said something he would regret, it couldn't be hidden any longer. So when Marco came back, it was heartwarming, surprising, and amazing. But he came back in a way no ever thought."

"-He couldn't stand the sight of the body anymore while she wanted nothing more than to lay there for eternity. She had spent hours holding Erwin's limp hand while they searched that basement. He wanted to be there so bad but he never made it. With an aggravated sigh, Levi decided he couldn't stand there and watch this any longer. It hurt too much. He knows that losing Erwin means losing her too. Her heart couldn't take losing another person she loved.- Currently being written as a short story but might make it longer- we'll see."

Erwin isn‚Äôt in it because he and the rest of the original squad lost their lives (or in Erwin‚Äôs case, his arm) in a plane crash. Levi used to be a professional violinist with his two friends. Moblit is the choreographer of the Scouts and he‚Äôs Hange‚Äôs partner. The Scouts all wear green jackets with the logo of a blue and white wing on a shield on their backs. Levi‚Äôs favorite drink is a London Fog from Starbucks. For team bonding nights the dance group usually goes out to bars to drink, but since they picked up a bunch of new people fresh out of Maria Academy (they call their students Cadets) Hange‚Äôs adamant that they not get arrested for six fake IDs. So now they go to Erwin‚Äôs house (Levi‚Äôs house too, but he doesn‚Äôt tell them that), and they watch movies and Erwin cooks because Levi would burn the house down if he cooked (because he takes forever since he‚Äôs a perfectionist)."
"‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Marie?‚Äù He asked, watching Levi‚Äôs face cloud with something strange for a moment. His hand moved from Erwin‚Äôs hairline, dropping to his lap. He seemed to shrink, growing smaller until he composed himself, sliding from the bed to the chair beside it. ‚ÄúHow should I know?

"Death, loss, and suffering was and is something that isn‚Äôt new to Levi. Rather, it is the only constant thing in his life. He only wanted to help give the kids living Underground a chance at a normal life. For them to not experience what he went through but as the scouts were on one of their errands of fetching orphans, the Survey Corps ended up having another criminal from the Underground as a soldier, Y/N. Y/N being one of the unfortunate to have been born underground with no citizenship to permanently stay on the surface, she had endured living in the confines of the subterranean city. And rather than choosing between death and being a harlot to live, she chose to be one of the underground‚Äôs bane by being a thief and a member of one of the Underground's notorious crime groups. Life for Y/N was just her doing everything she could to survive with the kids in her care and when the news of the King being replaced started to go around the Underground, she just kept on going as she used to, thinking that the changes in the ruler of the walls would only affect those who live above. Until Y/N was surprised to come home one night to an empty house."

"The kingdom of Maria has been ruled by Erwin Smith since he was twenty. Being king is not a position he particularly enjoys, but one he feels is his duty to live out. He once had dreams and inhibitions, but ultimately abandoned them for the sake of humanity. Five years after his crowning and nearly seven after the passing of his father, he meets an unruly assassin who will change the course of his history."
"It's only by chance that Eren Yeager meets Mikasa Ackerman on a bright, sunny day. He falls for her quickly, but it was impossible for him to know then that the great love of his life would also be the one to slip through his fingers.

Gray eyes briefly flashed with heartbreak. That settled it in Eren‚Äôs mind, she didn't even need to answer. Eren threw his jacket back to her. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who the fuck you‚Äôre seeing through me but I never hated you, Mikasa. Don‚Äôt be selfish and let me help you.‚Äù he hated how bitter he sounds. Eren hastily wrapped the red scarf around Mikasa, not giving her any chance to protest."

"They might have been only three little kids, living off scraps and anger. But they had lived and they had dreamt and they had made it here to the end of the world. Because Eren has always been so much like a fire. A fire that‚Äôs destructive and burning and ever-alight. But also like the fire one keeps at home, warm and filled with promises.

A surprising guest interrupts their conversation."
"Reiner and Bertholdt were too young be war machines. Too young to have shed bucketfuls of blood. Too young to be on their own in a strange land. Too young to be housed in a kind woman's home, hands roaming all over each other‚Äôs bodies while Annie slept just feet away. But when doomed to short lives and the heaviest weights upon their shoulders, why did it matter how fast they grew up? They stopped being children the day guns were placed in their small hands."
"A kingdom fresh out of war sees the return of its soldiers and its crown Prince, which while good for the Kingdom, is bad for the criminal underworld, or more specifically...Bertholdt. The increase in security means eating will get trickier, after all. Bertholdt didn't think life could get much worse. Of course, he had a tendency to be proven wrong."
"A compilation of drabbles and one-shots that don't have a set place within the ""Ties That Bind"" series."
"Levi suffers from short term memory loss, and while that makes it hard for him to find love, he finds Erwin."
"Written by AlinaJames, edited by Kasch. Post-sex Gallirei angst. Sometimes you share more than you expect. And other times you find solace in a place you never thought you would."
"After the big events, Armin feels horrible for more than one reason. Not knowing that right away, but playing a big role in the reason behind Armin's agony, Farlan comforts him."
"""Sorry soldier, shoes only sold in pairs."""
"From the moment he first saw him, Erwin knew that he and Levi had met before. He didn't know how or when, but he was certain that he knew the enigmatic little tea bar employee from somewhere. His interest in Levi only grew stronger as time went on, and he made it his mission to win Levi's affections. AU Reincarnation, modern setting."
"Prompt from slutty-eren on tumblr ""Angst? Eremin? How about Eren feeling really guilty after everyone had to come rescue him and Armin just trying to comfort him but Eren just gets pissed"" Post snk 50 It starts in a shower."
"Thousands of thoughts blur through his mind in the span of a second, enraged and guilt ridden.  It‚Äôs wrong.  Wrong.  Everything about it is wrong.  It‚Äôs Jean‚Äôs voice and Jean‚Äôs body but it‚Äôs so wrong."
"There was only one person he didn‚Äôt hate, and that was the little boy staring at him from across the street. His little nose was red and his eyes were bright as the sun and as green as the summer fields."

"Eren is a relatively unknown prodigy figure skater going out for his first-ever Olympics. His chosen event is pairs, and he's even more nervous than a normal nineteen-year-old would be. Eren's part of a controversial plot that will take the Olympic world by storm. Levi is a famous professional skater. He's won silver at his past two Olympics, and this one will be his last chance for the coveted gold. When his old friend Hanji calls in a debt, Levi has no choice but to suck it up, throw on a leotard, and go out with a bang."
"They were not simple folk, you see, though they were happy. But we do not say the words of cheer much any more. All smiles have become archaic. Given a description such as this one tends to make certain assumptions. Given a description such as this one tends to look next for the King, mounted on a splendid stallion and surrounded by his noble knights, or perhaps in a golden litter borne by great-muscled slaves. But there was no king. They did not use swords, or keep slaves. They were not barbarians. In a town filled with happiness, where nothing was lacking and sadness was a construct only found scrawled into dusty tomes, Eren Jaeger was born and lived and grew up. It was an enviable life, a good and wholesome life. And then, when he was twelve, everything changed."
"Levi has felt numb since the rooftop. Did he make the right choice?"
"He scratches my chest as he grapples with the front of my collar. ‚ÄúEren, are you giving up?‚Äù I take a hold of his wrist and wrench his hand from my shirt. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you remember what I said from our first conversation‚Ä¶‚Äù I stand with a new fire now boiling within my gut and hover my hand before my mouth. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll kill them all.‚Äù"
"In the safety of the trees, Eren won't stop struggling. Reiner gets carried away in an attempt to shut him up, and things quickly spiral out of control. [ch. 46, reiner/eren, thoroughly unpleasant]"
"[DA Request #2]  Another request from a wonderful person on DeviantArt. The prompt was for an angst fic with Erwin and the reader. Hopefully this is angsty enough, in contrast to my super fluffy Marco fic :)"
"Reiner is home. Everything seems to be where it belogs, except nothing is right."
"There's only so much Levi is willing to do for his fellow soldiers, especially when it comes to things that haunt all of them; like nightmares. But Erwin is the exception to everything. For Erwin, he would do anything, just to heal his pain."
"‚ÄúI want you to know before we go, I'm not someone you will want a relationship with.  I can give you tonight, but if you are looking for something deeper, I‚Äôm not the man you will want.‚Äù  Levi seemed to think about Erwin's confession for a moment. ‚ÄúGot it.  Hot as hell sex, but no marriage proposal.  I think I‚Äôll survive.‚Äù"
"After the battle to take back Trost from titans, there is something happening."
"Wohlan Freund! Jetzt hier ist dein sieg! Dies ist der erste... Marco stared at his dull reflection in the mirror. At the bent, distorted flesh that had once been his face. He might have reached up to touch it, if he'd still had a right arm. He considered the knife in his left hand. He felt tears at the back of his eyes when he considered the life-long ache in his hip, his inability to take a deep breath, and the monster that stared back out of the mirror. His voce dropped to a choked, ironic whisper. ""Gloria."""
"Based from a prompt: Levi decided to do something stupid, however, Erwin did not find it as a good idea. Levi Ackerman lost nearly everyone in his life. His mother, his ex-girlfriend, Farlan and Isabel, those people who he wished they never died. The man doesn't look forward to his future afterwards until there was only one person whom he almost forgotten before risking his life."
"Day 6: ABO/omegaverse AU Levi was told at a young age that he would never have children. After believing he would never have what he wanted, Eren refuses to let that become true. *This may be uncomfortable to some as Levi is infertile/cannot have children, causing him to be self-critical of himself and his relationship with Eren. Please read the notes at the beginning."
"""And it was love at first sight, at least on my end."" He rolled his eyes. ""You're so cheesy."" ""Only for you."" (Rated T+ for language)"
"There's a stark contrast between living within the walls and living without them, and it takes Levi a while of living on his own without them to figure out exactly what it is that he wants out life and his new found freedom. It takes him a while to figure out that it's Erwin that he wants."
"The third time Eren whimpers against Levi's throat, he's pinned underneath his commanding officer, wrists numb but bones unbroken. He shudders, shatters, dragging out hiccups until they shake his entire body. Levi's brows crease and he sets his head gently on Eren's chest. His fingers rub soothing circles on Eren's wrists, on Eren's palms, on Eren's arms, and he listens to him whimpering. Levi knows what he should do, but he's not entirely sure what he wants to do."
"""Sometimes when there is too much to focus on, focusing at all becomes too hard. A seemingly normal facade can hide something a lot more complicated. Everything feels blurred and a simple thought turns into a storm of ideas. Perfect grades and perfect lives can‚Äôt make up for everything in life. Affection can turn into pain and obsession."" Armins life is seemingly perfect, at least from the outside. He lives with both his parents in a nice neighborhood. His grades for his senior year are perfect. Him and all his friends are getting ready to leave for the same college come autumn. This doesn't stop Him from the constant feeling of being lonely, which leads to confused feelings."
"While Reiner dissociates from himself to bear his burden, Bertholdt finds his own escape in books. And he wishes more than anything the stories were a reality."
"I won't miss this world, but I'll always continue to miss you."
"THIS IS PART 2 - PLEASE SEE ""http://archiveofourown.org/works/10520289/chapters/23221770"" for the first part. Probably a very badly written sequel."
"Deciding to help Connie Springer may have been the worst decision of his life. Armin is blackmailed into sleeping with his instructor, with disastrous consequences. Note: this is labelled a Gen story for a reason. The focus is on the psychological problems and after-effects, not on any relationship."
"Based of a doujin by P:id=1947576. ‚ÄòOut of all the possibilities he envisioned their first meeting, he never imagined this.‚Äô"
"Years after the war‚Äôs conclusion, Levi opens a tea shop in a neat little town where he and Eren can find the respite they‚Äôve been fighting so hard for. But for Eren, the process of recovery has slowed to nothing. Is the love of a man who formerly held the title of Humanity‚Äôs Strongest enough to soothe this aching boy‚Äôs soul?"
"When recovery turns into an all-out angst parade and then into a sickening threesome, awkward and unhappy (and rated M for reasons), it's nothing but sheer humiliation in the end. Really, what else could that be? One-sided: Annie x Reiner, Reiner x Christa. However Bertholdt x Annie - might not be as one-sided. In author's wishful thinking. Enjoy at your own risk."
"Ever since your youths, the two of you have been quite the pair: the toddler son of a prostitute and the child-thief who protected him; a thug who could waltz and a whore who could kill; humanity‚Äôs strongest soldier and an officer‚Äôs mistress. And now, after years of separation: diamond and dust."
"The one in which Eren helps Levi learn he's loved."
"""His presence seems like a distant memory now."""
"In which Erin and Levy's choices in hair mean a lot more than outsiders might think (This description sounds sexist given that I genderbent them purely for this fic but I promise it's not)"
"Eventually the talking stops, the military commanders and squad leaders leave, and then it‚Äôs just Levi and Erwin, alone  together for the first time in...how long?  It could be days or weeks or months. So much has happened that Levi‚Äôs lost track of time. All that mattered was surviving.  And somehow they have.  Somehow, against all the odds, they are both still alive. Levi and Erwin re-unite after the Uprising."
"He didn‚Äôt want to go back to his apartment, to his empty bed, and feel that same gut-wrenching loneliness that had been eating away at him for weeks. Levi was nice. Levi wanted him. Levi would take care of him for the night."
"Hange knew that if she was more alert, she would have seen Bertholdt coming in. She knew that she could have warned everyone to take cover. They would have been safe."

"In the town of Trost, there lies two men who are worthy enough to be known as gods in the culinary field. Both are renowned graduates  from the 104th class under Sasha, the potato queen, at the Survey Corps Academy. But, one town can't have two esteemed establishments. With their future businesses on the line, Jean and Armin are determined to duke it out in one final battle of the chefs. The winner takes whatever he desires."
"He hadn't meant to hurt anyone. Call it the Curse of the Werecat, but blood gets spilled when a loved one is imperiled, regardless of whether that's what's desired at the moment. Of course, Armin was used to protecting Eren in such a manner... ... But why, this time, did he do the same for Farlan?"
"Eren, Mikasa, and Levi are sent deep undercover into Marley where Mikasa and Levi have to charade as a couple to keep their identities hidden."
"Story idea inspired by the song Rockabye by Clean Bandit."
"The string of fate is just as likely to wrap around someones neck as easily as their finger. Or The one where Jean is his. No, that's not right. Jean only becomes his after Marco dies. Because Jean- in his purest form- is Marco's. It's only grief that makes him Eren's."
"The mountains have been a secluded area from humans for many eons. The presence of a dragon kept even the most avid adventurers at bay. But that never stopped Eren. But when the townspeople are fed up with greed for new lands, Eren has no choice but to warn his friend of his approaching death. But will the ancient dragon heed the young human's words or accept his fate to leave the world?"
"Written for Zed as part of a collab she graciously asked me to do with her. I love you, darling.  She gave me the first few lines, a sneak peak of her art, and the premise, and I ran wild. HERE IS THE ART , oh dear god I'm a puddle. Erwin still sees Levi sometimes, at night when he can't tell if he's dreaming or haunted.  He doesn't care either way and he doesn't want morning to come."

"It's been many years since the Titans were defeated. With everyone leaving to live out the rest of their lives, Eren was lost. His only goal was to eradicate all titans, yet now that they were gone, he had no purpose. Alone, he set out on a journey to find a new start. Away from those who already forgot the past, away from the conviction of those gone, away from the harboring guilt of those living a lie. However, he never expected to meet a certain soldier when he went back to the old castle."
"When Armin shuts his eyes to avoid watching Jean being humiliatingly punished in front of the 104th, Levi decides to take both of them down to the dungeons and reveal the worst of everyone.

"Erwin's death hurts Levi. Until it doesn't have to."

Inspired by Macbeth by Shakespeare ‚ôû"

"Just a vent very short and depressing has double meanings idk see if you can work it out? i don't care."

Fortunately, there was one man who found him more than a monster. Levi Ackerman, behaviorist and professor, makes Eren's acquaintance one night at a bar after saving him from a boorish drunk.

With the only break from experimentations and torment is a friendly nurse, who can see past his monstrous abilities and promises to help him escape, he can only hold onto a slither of hope that his pain will end soon.

"He knew rain. It‚Äôs when water trickled down and the streets were thick with mud. When people got stuck under landslides and suffocated to death; choking on dirty viscous earth.

Each knot broke the skin of the blades, water oozing and itchy. But it was routine; rip, cross, over, around, and pull; rip, cross, over, around, and pull; drip, cross, drip, around, and drip. There were droplets first, they fell in his hair. There was no pattern just the occasional soft plunk. Then he saw it, coming up over the walls, across the flat, flat land, up onto his hill; carving out a trail. It was a solid mass of storm.

"The warmth encircling his hand was more comforting than it had any right to be, and Levi let Hange linger there. He could only imagine what she had gone through, dragging his unconscious ass through a river while being chased by brainless idiots."
"‚ÄúErwin knelt down next to Levi and put a gentle hand on his shoulder. ‚ÄúLevi,‚Äù He said softly, and Levi‚Äôs grey eyes flashed open and he immediately sat up and socked Erwin in the face. ‚ÄúYou bastard!

Legends say that once someone goes near the river, the water calls out to you in a gentle, alluring voice. It tugs you closer and closer, lulling you with its sweetness and beauty. The pull overtakes you until you‚Äôre not even conscious of your being. Instead, all you desire to do is to jump into its depths and forget everything . The reason why Mikasa remembered this story more than others is because Mikasa was undeniably happy with her peaceful life.

The boy in his dreams is always bleeding. His hands are puckers of scar tissue and bruises, never fully healed before he tears them apart again. The boy in his dreams is a ghost inside of a seashell. His voice ricochets like bullets, raining blood over the upturned faces of angels. The boy in his dreams fades by morning, and sometimes, when Armin wakes up, he is already crying."

It is no secret, and Erwin would be remiss to say he doesn‚Äôt flex it on occasion. The fact of the matter is this: Erwin makes the calls, and Levi does obey. Erwin could speculate on why for months or years, probably. He has some ideas‚Äìtheories of blood and vows that can‚Äôt be broken‚Äìbut the obedience is constant and unshakable, and that is all that really matters."

It‚Äôs alright.‚Äù You wipe bile from your lips. And you straighten. And she is wrong. - Armin Arlert, on life: giving it, taking it, and learning how to live it."
"Armin was sick of his own sadness, how fragile it made him feel‚Äîthe way everyone treated him, as if he were that fragile. But Jean was one of the few that still looked at him like he was flesh and blood rather than a sheet of glass. (Spoilers up to chapter 138 of the manga, based on the 'what if' scenario presented there. In the aftermath of Eren and Mikasa‚Äôs choice, Armin seeks comfort from a reliable source.)"
"""The knock at the door broke her from her daydream and she sat up, suddenly unsure if it was real. The knock happened again and once more. This time a loud fourth and a frantic jiggle at the knob. She shuddered but dare not move. ""Mikasa."" He said for the first time out loud."" ---- TLDR: Mikasa doesn't know if she can do this with Eren again. Eren knows she can... with some convincing."
"He has been listening for too long. Like an eavesdropping child crouching outside mother's door as she cries because her son just. won‚Äôt. listen. to a goddamn thing she says. So he will call them to Ymir‚Äôs playground because he has to set them straight but also because he wants them to hear his voice. He wants them to hear his voice because he has no one to talk to and Ymir cannot talk-- to him and he is lonely and he wants to hear their voices because it is quiet in her playground. ______ Eren has a moment of weakness when he hears Mikasa's plea to him in paths."
"What you and Eren have...isn't a relationship. You're not his girlfriend, his significant other, the person he loves most. You're just...his."
"If only things had been different."
"Levi instantly ducked his right arm under Erwin‚Äôs, brushing it away with a harsh swat. Flinching as if burned, eyes blown wide open. Erwin grimaced. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fuckin‚Äô touch me, ya‚Äô filthy pig. We‚Äôre not buddies,‚Äù the raven snapped lowly, accent flowing thickly. Grey glazed over with fury. His eyes pinched in along with his eyebrows. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ya‚Äô forget what ya‚Äô fuckin‚Äô did. I still hate ya‚Äô guts, Smith. Just because I decided to follow ya‚Äô doesn‚Äôt mean I particularly like ya‚Äô, ya‚Äô hear?‚Äù ‚Ä¶ Recovering from the deaths of his family, Levi seeks condolence. He gets it in the form of Erwin Smith. (Post-ACWNR, After Isabel and Farlan‚Äôs death.)"
"‚ÄúMikasa.‚Äù There‚Äôs a mix of fear and revulsion in Levi‚Äôs eyes that makes her take a step back the way anger or scorn in them would not. ‚ÄúThey are not going to give you that procedure. They are going to lock you into a room until you give birth, and they are going to take... it away, and they won‚Äôt care if it has twelve fingers or three eyes or the intelligence of a sponge, and they will raise it to be a weapon against humanity. Is that what you want?‚Äù ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what do I do?‚Äù she croaks. He sighs and rubs at his eyes again. ‚ÄúGet rid of it on your own.‚Äù"

"Love letters, daring, sexual, romantic, longing, farewell letters, all to one person."
"The second that Eren had permission to, they all but ran to their room. It had been hours since they weren‚Äôt under the watchful eye of someone. They stopped at the door of their room, hesitating, and corrected their thoughts. It wasn‚Äôt their room; it was merely a room in the basement that they had no choice but to stay in. It was optimally positioned that were they to lose control, the Levi squad could easily subdue them. It was merely a tactically advantageous place for them to rest and have a little privacy. Privacy that was feigned at that. The door didn‚Äôt even lock, so that during the night they could check that they hadn‚Äôt fled or was ‚Äòattempting communication with the enemy‚Äô, whatever that meant. Opening the heavy door, they slipped inside and breathed for the first time since they had touched the spoon and exploded into Titan form."

He would've had to be in my school because it's the schools ball but I swear I've never seen him... The next day I woke up to him in a bed, and his mask was off... No way wait. It's... LEVI?!

That had been their farewell, they could never tie each other down with the word ‚Äòlove.‚Äô It didn‚Äôt seem right to say it in a world like this because they never knew what could happen a few hours from now, tomorrow, or even a year. Yet, Levi had hoped to hear those words someday."
"Pieck and Jean have both lost someone extremely special to them. Now that things have settled, it's about time they tackle those feelings and move on..."
"There were no choices for Mikasa, there was only Eren, and his will. There was only him. There would only ever be him. It was selfish, his reasoning, he could admit that. He would always be selfish with her, would always take and take and take, would always keep her tethered, would never allow anyone else to get close to what he had of her, would never let her give what she gave to him to anyone else. Distantly, it‚Äôs all he ever wanted, the only thing he craved besides freedom, and he wanted it bad. He wanted to hear her choose him, again, wanted her to look past his sins, past right and wrong, just to be with him a little longer. ‚Äî Mikasa visits Eren in his cell after Liberio, attempting to understand. He prepares to destroy them both. In other words; Mikasa, Eren, and giving in to his greatest sin yet."

I wanted to compare Erwin and Levi's reactions, their ideas to get out of there alive, their feelings, for the same situation. The first chapter is mostly in Levi's head, Erwin is injured.

In this story, Levi is in a D/s relationship with Erwin Smith, but the Commander has told his boy he thinks Levi is a switch and should look for a pet of his own, because Erwin wants Levi to be happy and fulfilled and to be operating at maximum effectiveness and to do that, he needs an outlet for his aggressive, dominant side. This story takes place immediately after Levi kicks the crap out of Eren in front of the Military Tribunal in order to convince them to turn him over to the Survey Corps. They don't trust Eren yet, or know what kind of a threat he may be. In this anime, Levi does keep Eren chained up in a cell in the basement while he tries to decide if he's a monster or not. In this story, how he comes to that decision is a little more interesting than sitting around watching him and cursing at him from time to time. They haven't totally realized that Eren has to harm HIMSELF to shift, so Levi decides to conduct a brutal experiment that ends up having an unexpected result. And everything changes."
"Kenny wasn't exactly the best at taking care of others, but with the absence of Levi's father, teaching the runt to drive didn't seem like such a hard task. That's what everyone thought. It wasn't until Levi woke up did he realize he wanted to punch his uncle for being both a blessing and a curse. The next realization he had was he'd come face to face with an angel."
"Erwin would always tell Levi about his phantom pains, how he would feel sudden pain where the rest of his arm was missing."
"So I wrote the original version like 5 years ago, but recently I was going through my old drive and found it and fell in love with it again. so I rewrote the entire thing and here you go!"
"Eren has had a rough childhood, from his mom dying at a young age to a father who treats him as if he doesn't exist. He had to find a way to survive, and that way was to sell himself to the other boys at high school. Then he gets a break. As suggested one of his regulars, Jean Kirstein, he tries out becoming a professional in an omega bar. It was only meant as a joke when it left the horse faced boys lips, but to everyone's surprise, Eren is a prodigy in the area. He soon has a job at a local club and his life finally has started to take a turn for the better. Then Levi walks, literally, into his life and things get unnecessarily complicated for the young adult."
"It's the first Paradisan Eldian expedition back to the mainland and things are . . . weird, between the young members of Squad Levi. Much to Jean's confusion, his ex-lover Armin, who has been giving him the cold shoulder for years after ending their brief but intense relationship, begins flirting with him once they set foot in Marley. Or is that Jean's desperate imagination? Drunkenly confronting Armin at a party (started by the perpetually broody Eren, of all people), Jean may get more than he bargained for . . . My interpretation of and additions to the November 2019 chapter of SnK, chapter 123. This story takes place in the same universe as my Jearmin Week 2019 fic, A Life Within Walls."
"(I'm reposting my fics after they were deleted.) After so long of being treated like prisoners as well as outcasts, Eren wants his family to finally break free from oppression and flee to a great, wide world that awaits them. Yet on their way he and Levi must realize there are things they cannot protect their children from. This is the sequel to ""Just Mpreg Things""!! It continues right where we left off~"
"Holy fuck, Eren could not believe that be was at finally at No Name's concert, for the very first time, and that L was standing close in front of him, in the flesh. Well, as close as his poor fanboy ass could possibly be at his what-was-considered cheap (which, let's admit it here, was fucking expensive to him considering his shitty university pocket money, and the amount he'd just spent could last him many months worth of cheap disgusting cafeteria food) seat next to Armin, who was also geeking out just as much as him. Okay, maybe just a little less than him."
"Eren chases after Levi fruitlessly for four years, and Levi doesn't recognize his own feelings until every living creature on the planet is hitting on Eren. Then, they're happy together. Their relationship begins in high school, and it never technically ends. Levi just never got the chance to say goodbye."
"Sina Psychiatric Hospital is where Armin Arlert has dwelled for quite some time. While he‚Äôs been known for being the odd one of the so called freaks of ward 12, he believes he‚Äôs fine with his only friend Eren, whom he has a deep relationship with. When a newcomer called Levi is admitted to the same ward as him, and in fact the same room, he causes Armin to constantly question himself and his small, dark life."

"For the past ten or so months, you'd been a member of the Scout Regiment, and for three of those months you'd been a member of Squad Mike. The only issue in regards to your position that you could find as of late, was that you'd noticed you had a minor attraction to your Squad Leader. An attraction that was steadily beginning to make you feel flustered everytime he so much as looked or spoke to you. There was really no other way of putting it: You fancied the pants off of Section Commander Mike Zacharias. Title inspired by the song ""I Can't Help Falling In Love With You"" by Elvis Presley"
"Eren Jaeger, a college student at Shiganshima University, collapsed (literally) into Levi's life. When a small mishap during Levi's lunch break submerged him into something he could never believe. Could one of Trost Hospital's most hardass doctors and a dying brat really hit it off or will fate tear them apart?"

When the two meet in the parking lot of Starbucks, problems happen."
"You met him in the streets of underground and became his shadow ever since."
"A collection on one-shots written for Winmin Week 2014. Mostly canonverse. 01. Superior and Subordinate: Armin was conflicted. They were superior and subordinate after all, kept apart by rules and regulations and just plain common sense.

"Eren Yeager has finally gotten what he‚Äôs always wanted. He‚Äôs finished his training and has officially been named a member of the Scout Regiment. He‚Äôs admired these brave soldiers that could go beyond the wall his entire life and through them, he may finally be able to seek vengeance for his parents‚Äô deaths. And then he meets Captain Levi Ackerman, a hard man with obscene fighting prowess. Once his idol and now a constant source of annoyance, Levi forces Eren to prove his place among the scouts and eventually ropes him in for an adventure he‚Äôd never even dreamt of. A/N I‚Äôm literally AWFUL at summaries. I promise it‚Äôll be better than I made it sound."

There, she meets Levi, a stoic but capable man, a man with a dark past of his own. As she tried to move on, the things she sees keep trying to suck her back to a darker world but for some reason he is safe, someone who keeps the bad away. But will the past keep coming back to haunt her? Will the things she sees follow her for the rest of her life? Or will she finally be able to forget what had happened to her with the help of a mostly serious, germaphobic man. He might very well be the key that could save her life."
"Eren is a young tropical mer that got lost from his pod. Levi is a deep sea mer that smells Eren and believes him to be his next meal until he comes face to face with the young creature and desides that he wishes to mate. Levi being Levi doesn't have the best approach at first but soon he is about to win him over. (No actual smut, just fluffy courting. MILD violence of the bat because Levi doesn't know what he is doing but he doesn't hurt Eren)"
"The first time Levi comes to Erwin, he sends him away, refusing to take advantage. The second time, he isn't quite that strong. But who is using who?"
"Erwin will be the next commander in a very short time; Levi has lost everything that mattered to him. Their lives are changing; they are heading together toward that landscape painted with mysteries that is on the other side of the walls. The problem will arise when those changes, by reviving old memories, make their minds tortured by past, guilt and fear waver in front of the uncertain. Perhaps, what they need to move forward is to know they can trust someone else. What they don't know is that, in order to build that trust, they will need to undress themselves body and soul before the other, doing so to face the unexpected chain of events that will turn their expectations and dreams upside down. Because only a living heart can fully feel the freedom that awaits them at the end of the battle. *** Eruri, Pre-SNK, Post-ACWNR.

"Another loud boom of thunder is what woke her from her peaceful state. Her eyes opened as she observed her surroundings. It was hard to see due to how much rain was falling now. She looked down to the river, watching it flow, until something caught her eye. There was something floating in the river! Squinting her eyes to see better, she came to the realization that that something was actually a person. Based on chapter 115. I‚Äôll write a better summary later, but I promise this is good!!"

"After a stroke of terrible luck, you're taken by an enemy nation as a prisoner of war. Your fate? Either to be killed off, or used to negotiate your kingdom's surrender. Of course, that is until you're freed by a group of mysterious combatants who are dead-set on keeping you safe. Though for what reason, you're not very sure. Now, off on an unfamiliar terrain, you're forced to latch onto a man who you can't seem to figure out. But he's the only thing keeping you alive."
"Eren falls. Not in the way that angels do, most of the time- He does not become less worthy, like his mother once told him it happened to angels that fell- he gets hit, stumbles, and comes down onto his ass. He falls in a literal sense."
"Glasses were clinked. Beer was downed in a gulp. A kiss was exchanged. A celebration was what it was supposed to be. A tragedy became what it was unexpected to be. Little did they know that the next day of their lives would not only bring a huge conflict, but a new life as well. A child was what Hanji least expected. But what terrified her more was the fact that the father was a cold, titan shredder. Who it is, you ask? Let's just say that he's the Captain that everybody fears. And she's way too petrified to even tell him. Hearts were broken, with secrets unspoken. Love had bloomed. But will it bring life to the world? Or will it carry humanity's doom?"

"‚ÄúSorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to stare.‚Äù The boy replied awkwardly to which Levi rolled his eyes and looked out the window. ‚ÄúYou just look really tired.‚Äù Levi‚Äôs gut clenched as he looked back and blinked at the young man. In all honesty, Levi didn‚Äôt exactly know what to say, and he would never quite understand why five simple words from a person he didn‚Äôt know rendered him speechless."
"Levi heads out in the dead of night only to find things complicated when Eren follows him."

"My life had always been the same. The same daily routine for the last two years. I lived in a rather quiet town. It was small with a few people, it wasn‚Äôt packed with buildings and high traffic, we had a local mall with a few shops and caf√©s. There were a couple other stores and food places placed around in the town. One was the one I worked in, ‚ÄòCreativeBloom‚Äô , a flowershop. It wasn‚Äôt on the big side when it comes to size, but it was cozy and I enjoyed working there. It was placed a little closer to the water, so whenever the sky was clear I had the most stunning view out over the sea. I was still a student. And I was poor. But I didn‚Äôt mind. My life hadn‚Äôt totally turned to shit yet. I lived a peaceful and happy life honestly I liked it and didn‚Äôt see a reason why I would want anything to change. All of that very suddenly changed. After that day one man quite aggressively walked into my store, and changed everything I ever thought I knew. Dianthus- the Latin word for carnations, Levi gets obsessed with them. English isn‚Äôt my first language so sorry if I have stupid grammatical mistakes and such^^‚Äô"

When loving someone comes at the expense of yourself, how much are you willing to give--how much can you give before it breaks you? (Or the petty teenage drama nobody asked for.

Between a bad history in romance and a failing flower shop, Levi's afraid he'll never have the chance to win him over."
"Eren hated this Levi person that had just sauntered into his life like he owned the world. This Levi had insulted his manner of speaking, stole his best friend, punched him in the face, and then beat up the other person who punched him. Levi was a shoulder to cry on when someone important had died, was actually much nicer than he acted, and was actually a really good kisser. Levi had beautiful hands, pretty eyes, a lovely rare smile and magic hands that stole thoughts and feelings and locked them in words. Also, he's a closeted sap. Eren loves this Levi person who has been in his life for so many years. Levi hated this Eren kid who had to ruin what might have been a relatively decent second chance at life. This Eren insulted his height, couldn't ever train his dog to stop chewing on everything, tried to tear his only friend away, and punched him in the back of the head. Eren is vulnerable and always needs a shoulder to cry on, pretends to be stronger than he is for reasons that make no sense, and is one seriously sloppy ass kisser. Eren has bright eyes and a crooked grin and magic hands that capture the world. Also, he's good at making tea. Levi loved this Eren person who made everything feel worth it."

It, his breathing, the universe, the way the world spins when he plants both feet on the floor and tries to haul himself out of bed. It‚Äôs the same feeling as being at sea for a long time and forgetting what it means to walk on land. Everything seems to sway, as if he can still feel the ebb and flow of waves beneath his feet, even though he has never seen the ocean in his life.

Never did he think that he'd be chasing wolves."
"Fate; be destined to happen, turn out, or act in a particular way. Will; expressing a strong intention or assertion about the future. The sound of lead moving rapidly against paper, Eren Jeager writes down his struggles through fate and will. Light and darkness, sin and virtue, peace or destruction. They say the stars align to ones fate, or ones will may lead them to success or defeat. Will he choose to remain in righteousness under the wing of King Erwin in Galiessa kingdom, or venture in the unknown realm of King Levi in Kingdom Of Ciramma? Will he walk along the brightest path or the one leading to chaos?"
"Connie is uneasy about attending his high school reunion; afraid that his inability to keep up with people has torn them too far apart. But this reunion turns out to be exactly what he needed; in more ways than one."
"There was so much he wanted to say. Unfold a million words. His heart felt like it was pouring itself out of his chest. I want to touch you one last time. Written for Eruri week 2015 Prompt 4: Touch"
"When Levi begins dreaming of a strange world he doesn't recognize, he begins to wonder if there is something more behind it than the simple ramblings of an unconscious mind."
"Eren was supposed to only be another blurred face that passed me by through the school corridors; an insignificant human that barely influenced the life I led. So how, through all the curves and ambushes laid out by fate, did he become what he has? A vital piece to all of our lives, the very beating heart that keeps the world moving, coloured, and breathing the life I had craved in the monotone of uniformity. And all this came from the inner boundaries of that fence; the wall that separated us from the tragedy of his life. Eren Jaeger; show me what you hide behind your white picket fence. Show me the monster I know you have become."
"None"
"Being the Commander of the Survey Corps is not as glamorous as it may seem. While Erwin seems to be a very strong, well put together leader, when returns from missions, he crumbles. Thankfully, Levi's there to pick up the pieces. A one shot for Day 4 of Eruri Week ""Touch"". Rated T for nudity and bathing (nothing NSFW)."
"Erwin has always talked in his sleep. This time, Levi talks back."

Eren had found the owner of the words tattoed in his forearm‚Ä¶ and he was having an anniversary dinner with someone else -- What if... you found your soulmate a bit too late?"
"Eren, the son of two very wealthy and well-known people, can't bring himself to cut back on smoking- or running into trouble. But in the moment of a desperate situation, Levi, a highly skilled assassin and number one on America's Most Wanted list, accidentally swoops into Eren's life. Things take a wild turn for the two as Levi tries his damnedest to get his assignment taken care of while Eren is rapidly becoming a fatal distraction for the man."

"Levi, not that he would admit it, was scared of happiness. It seems crazy, but when you think about it, it's really not. When you're happy, it can be taken from you, and Levi had had happiness taken from him more times than most. He was cautious about it. The thing was, Eren was a different kind of happiness. A better kind, that made Levi actually, truthfully happy. Unfortunately, the more happy you are, the easier it is the have the rug pulled from under your feet, and that's exactly what happens."
"Levi has been away from home for five years. When he finally works up the courage to visit again after all this time and renew family ties he thinks everything will be how he left it, except he didn't consider that his sweet and pure little brother is now an attractive and mature grown up that's on his mind more and more often that he cares to admit."

His only clues lay in a journal, which he quickly discovers holds some gruesome secrets."
"more for the sad otp challenge I did on tumblr. I find it sad when two characters like each other but never act on it or choose not to for valid but also disappointing reasons."
"It was a feeling that seeped into his bones. A feeling that took every part of him that was alive and energized, and dulled it all to an almost painful numbness. And here he was. Sixteen going on seventeen, and tired in general. So tired and sad and with it came the anger. He didn't even realize that something was changing until his friends started avoiding him. And by the time he realized, he had already snapped."
"Idk it is literally 3am, do I have to write this??? Levi and Eren have an emotion angsty convo and then they bang, okay?"
"Jean shot an accusing look. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre seeing Levi behind my back, Eren.‚Äù Jean pleads for Eren to stay with him. Levi threatens to end his relationship with Eren if he doesn‚Äôt end it with Jean. Eren‚Äôs already chosen‚Ä¶but his decision wavers as he recalls exactly how much both men have touched his heart.

"Far, far up the stairs, at the top of the tower, above all but the stars, was Levi. It had been ages since he'd been down there. One hundred and eighty-seven years at his last count, though that, too, had been ages ago. The town itself hadn't even existed then; It had been a mighty expanse of forest. Thirty years later, it was a tiny village. Forty years after that, it was a bustling little town. And one hundred and twenty years after that, the little village had blossomed into what was now the kingdom's capital, the tower neatly placed at one of its many edges. It was lonely, seeing it age so when he hadn't aged at all. Erwin's presence was the only thing that made the ageless decades bearable. A fantasy AU, primarily based upon Rapunzel, in which Erwin is a wizard in charge of keeping Levi, a beast, safely locked away from the rest of the world, no matter the cost."

"Humanity's strongest warrior.  A hero to many, a monster to some.  Seemingly invincible, unflinching and undeterred.

The heart is the enemy.  The beauty is the beast.  Is it ever worth it?"
"Levi‚Äôs never been good at saying sorry."
"A new, insanely popular video game has just been released called Attack On Titan. Hanji leaves no room for objections from Levi, and so he's dragged into this virtual gruesome world full of violence, death, and gore. His favorites all in one. But when a glitch in the game brings along a sequence of strange events and a pair of unforgettable eyes, everything Levi thought he knew about gaming turns to ash and he's afraid to face the unsettling truth behind this alluring video game character named Eren."
"The Jaeger family was known to be devoted. Going to church whenever possible to volunteer and to pray, It's no wonder why God has been such an important part on young Eren's life. Who new that once Eren became an altar boy his place of Sanctuary would turn into his own Hell."

"Eren is a senior in high school, his parent's marriage is falling apart, he is always being passed up by Mikasa. But when Eren's friends take him on a double date he slowly becomes more than friends with a college freshman, that happens to change his life for the worst and better."
"Honestly, this summary barely touches on the things in this fic. It started as college AU and has kind of moved in to present drama and past historical mystery drama and possible reincarnation. You just need to start it, give it a chance, and go with the flow. Armin, Eren, and Jean start college and their lives become a dramatic tangle of lies, love, and secrets. Erwin and Levi are two retired marines, RAs at the university, and partners who after nearly dying in Middle East are trying to live their lives peacefully and productively. Unfortunately, things are not as they should be at the university and Levi and Hanji's ground breaking research is the target of a secret group whose influence extends around the world. Erwin feels the need to continue his father's work fighting the group and slowly but surely as it all comes together things become even more convoluted and no one is really who they are or telling the whole truth."
"It's the year 2150 and renowned scientist Hanji Zoe has finally perfected a time machine. Hanji uses it to send Eren back in time. So what happens when he gets stuck in the era of the Titans? Mythical creatures that Eren hadn't heard about since he was five. Eren ends up meeting people who look exactly his friends from his time. Including himself. He doesn't have a clue what to do, nor how long it will take his Hanji to get him back to their own time period. He's not trusted and just wants to go home. This was all too weird for him.

"""Upon wandering to their room, he recognized the sound of some soft music. He knew the song almost immediately, since it was more gentle than Marco‚Äôs usual stuff, but the song he heard was one saved for special days.

"A school trip to Paris turns into more than Jean could have ever expected. Ever heard of love at first sight? Neither had the freckled boy across the hall. Jean is in for more than he expects, and it all starts with the image of freckles and Jaegers dick."
"Levi is having a rough night, trying to exhaust himself into no-longer remembering anything that might break down his carefully constructed demeanor. Will a certain ocean-eyed cadet be able to help him?"
"Eren sees people's memories when he touches their skin. Dead or alive, he can see them. Fond or Scarring, he can observe them with a single touch. Maybe it's a blessing? His parents used to say. Eren doesn't think so."
"Levi was just getting by, strolling the streets for some extra cash, not to mention he'd get sex from it was a bonus. An unstable, juggled life he was living. Then enters Erwin, a mysterious blond man who strolls into his life with a suitcase full of cash asking for him to quit his 'job.' Levi would have taken it from the first glance but there was something behind that charming smile of his client that made him hesitate. It was dangerous. And Levi was sure he was never going to be able to resist him any longer."

"From the very beginning, Levi could only see one shade of blue. From the very beginning, Erwin could only see one shade of green. As time passes, their colors begin to blur, but will they change, or fade?"
"After Marco‚Äôs death my depression only got worse. Things at home were still in deep shit, too. So now I‚Äôm here, on a bridge by a road where nobody passes through, about to end my life. It‚Äôs kind of scary but I‚Äôve realized there is literally nothing for me to live for. I‚Äôve racked my brain for so long trying to think of something, anything that might prevent me from killing myself. But since that seemed to have been a useless effort, I decide it's about time. Nobody will miss me, so there was nothing holding me back. I wasn't expecting to be interrupted by a loudmouthed brunette driving a Ford Mustang."
"Eren watched this and fell to his knees, the tears in his eyes streaming down as he shook his head, ‚ÄúNo...no‚Ä¶no no no no no, please‚Ä¶‚Äù He could hear feet crushing grass behind him and shouts. ‚ÄúEren!‚Äù They got closer, but he paid no mind to them, only to the figure of a titan running in the distance.

"Jean is a broke college dropout playing his beat-up guitar for change in the park when he finds his sunshine that breaks through the cloudy skies of his life. ""It all started in this park.

"Everyone dies and my hope dies with them."
"He‚Äôd been released from the infirmary the day before, still wearing the pajamas they‚Äôd put him in there. Instantly Levi felt a surge of anger.

"Look, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have nothing against the whole matrimonial, paternal, fairy tale life. It‚Äôs just not for me, not for Jean Kirstein. I mean, I‚Äôve got a decent job, a nice place to live, awesome friends, what else could I ask for? Call me a free spirit, that‚Äôs okay, because, whoever came up with this idea that you have to fall in love, live in a huge mansion, have lots of babies in order to live happily ever after is just not true.

"Armin is roommates to boyfriends Eren and Jean, and has dealt with the shenanigans that come with living with the two. Despite liking both boys more than he should, he keeps his emotions to himself and finds a girl to date. For one month he's in complete relationship bliss until it all comes crashing down one Saturday night when Marco appears at their door. An imagining of what could go wrong between best friends and confused college kids in love. This in the same vein as Don't Wait but an alternative ending of the dispute at the end of chapter 2. This is not canon to tat story and never will be canon to that story bc I'm not that cruel."
"Ever since Eren was a child, he wanted to go to the Olympics. He wanted to be the best of the best. Several years later and nothings really changed, besides a few scars that he's still healing from. But at least his dream is coming true. Well, his dream is a year and one massive tournament away, but it's coming true. All he has to do is get top scores at this tournament and he'll be on his way to Rio! There's a few problems, though. His father has never approved of this dream, his friends are constantly worrying about him (which just stresses him out), there's a douche-bag with a horse face from France, and his biggest idol is also competing. Things become even more complicated when he realizes that he's falling in love with his idol, a beauiful, short man from France. No it's not the horse-face guy. It's someone he never expected to compete with. Levi Ackerman. Or the one where two boys that wear a lot of spandex and do flips'n'stuff fall in love and succeed at being totally rad gymants. (A.K.A the fic no one asked for but I desperately needed.)"
"""Levi, your grades are surprising me lately."" The senior said nothing to this, but continued to stare at Erwin evenly with his dark grey-blue eyes, his mouth set in a firm line as if to defy that anything was amiss. The professor went on, ""I know that you're under a lot of stress, being in your senior year, but that's normal and you're not one to let mere stress break you so easily. You've proven that to me over the years, so please tell me, what's going on with you?"" It was very obvious that Levi did not want to have this conversation. His thin fingers tightened on the strap of his shoulder bag, his jaw set in even closer, and his eyes dropped swiftly from his professor's blue ones. After a few uncomfortable seconds of silence, he muttered, ""Nothing."""

Unfortunately, Eren is found and killed by the very hunters he used to work with, and Levi does nothing but blame himself. 200 years later, Levi meets a certain green-eyed boy, similar to that of his lover.  Levi now believes that he is the reincarnation of him. Not knowing whether fate is being cruel or giving him a second chance, Levi decides to not get involved with him. Eren, however, is having dreams about the man he's never met until now and wants to know why."

For now, all that's left to do is try to survive 'til graduation‚Äîand perhaps even learn a little about each other before then. [FINALLY OFF HIATUS AND ONGOING!]"
"People always fantasize about having unique lives full of excitement and adventure. But take off that romanticized mask that media places on EVERYTHING now a days and the reality of it is far less than charming. Eren might have been a 'magical boy', but he didn't fight for any of that love and friends nonsense. He fought to survive. What will happen when a man who's been at this game almost twice as long meets and than has to work with the walking corpse of a boy?"
"After the battle against the beast titan, Levi is furious at Eren for going on a wild rampage, even though he'd won. But, at what cost did Eren win?"

"Jean/Armin High School AU. Lots of fluff, a little bit of angst."
"At 10, he witnessed the massacre of his family and friends. His mother had sacrificed herself so that he would be able to run away and hide. He still regrets that decision; He believed if he stayed and fought, he wouldn't have had to watch everyone get killed. All of this, he thought. All that killing just for eyes. They weren't special, but the color captured everyone's attention. At 15, while holding the daughter of a family that took him in, he realized he brought death wherever he went. So he ran. Ran until he couldn't no more. At 17, he doesn't trust anyone. He doesn't smile nor laugh. At 19, he's ready to die. He's cornered by the same people who killed his family and as he closes his eyes, he's saved. For the first time in years, he makes a friend. The only problem is, he's told to hide his eyes if he wants to live. It isn't easy when suddenly he has to live in a house with people after his eyes.

What does Levi think when the teen suddenly goes missing? Could he possibly help Eren see that he isn't just a wreckless monster? Or will he be too late to help at all?

Or could this begin something more life changing than the words he had heard of his mother's health? Modern AU"
"Levi is mentally ill. His greatest fear is it to become infected with bacteria. Repeated hand washing and gloves preserve him from the worst, or so he thinks. As one day his co-worker has an accident and he can't help them because he's disgusted, he wants to change.

"I turned around and my jaw dropped. I was staring into light grey eyes. I had seen this vampire before. He was one of the vampires that had attacked my village. I couldn‚Äôt help but gape at him as I remembered that day. I remembered seeing my dead friends and family littered across blood spattered grass. I remembered my body pulsing with hatred as we charged at each other, both with the cutthroat intention to tear the other apart. He was scowling at me, his thinly sculpted, cruel face appearing more handsome than I remembered. The harsh lamplight caused shadows to creep under his eyes and down his neck, somehow making him seem even more attractive. ‚ÄúWho the hell are you looking at, boy?‚Äù"

"Levi has always remembered. The war, the Titans, all of it. Most people would think he was crazy if he told them; in this world, after all, it was physically impossible for humans to turn into man-eating giants several meters tall.

Not all of them recall their past lives, though, and Levi isn't sure if he envies them or not. When Levi runs into a young man with achingly familiar green eyes and no memory of the history they shared, Levi's first instinct is to push him away, to let him live this life with a freedom he never had in the other. He doesn't count on Eren being just as stubborn this time around as the last, memories or no."

"To wear a mask every day can be tiring, facade maintained at all times to block out reality and start anew. It can also be a source of enjoyment, playing the part of someone possessing qualities that weren't instilled since birth, characteristics chosen instead of predetermined. When one such individual collides with another cut from the same cloth, inevitable sparks fly, strong yet false personalities steady and unwavering as there's never any fear of letting anyone get too close, solid walls high and impenetrable. Usually. What happened was unexpected, foreign, minds not prepared for the events that came from a chance meeting during one of many guises. Someone walked into Eren's life and pulled those barriers down without even trying, allowing their own to crumble in the process, the results as surprising as they were exciting."

"Eren Jaeger was confused. He didn't know how he was supposed to feel. He was used to have such loving friends. He used to be a gung-ho, happy-go-lucky kinda guy. He used to enjoy life and what it offered. And now he was swamped with projects and losing sleep. He spent his days alone despite being used to the company of others. He felt like he was losing some unknown battle he didn't sign up for. He didn't have anyone to turn to nor had any one to even bother updating about his daily life. He felt dread.

But after an unfortunate run in with a couple of desperate rival gang members, Eren and Armin were backed into a corner. Literally. Now the spoiled prince has to learn to fend for himself in a world of deals and underground operations, and that means no more gifts, no more apartment, and most importantly, no one to run crying to.

"Jean misses Marco. He misses him so much. More than a year has passed since his death, but Jean still can't come to terms with it. But then one day, Jean discovers Marco's ghost, and things slowly start to get better."
"Rain was pouring down on the glass of his bedroom windows, filling the silence in the room. Lightning struck somewhere nearby, though it went unnoticed as Levi cradled his head with his forearms as he stared at the floor blankly. Thunder cracked through the night, shaking even the sturdy house where Levi sat. The last time Levi saw his lover was yesterday, and it was far too long for him."
"But if one thing is going to change, it‚Äôll be Armin. He‚Äôs going to get his future. Eren will make sure of it this time."

Yet Levi has a secret of his own, one that he conceals at great cost. And one that he intends to carry to his grave, whenever that day comes. Levi never anticipated meeting a young Alpha by the name of Eren Jaeger. Nor, during that first meeting, did the two of them anticipate just how close they would eventually become."
"They said that love turned up when least expected, hiding round the corner to take you by surprise and steal the breath from your lungs. You'd never believed in such drivel, convinced life held nothing but short relationships which ended in disappointment, until an unannounced and old-fashioned incident made you think otherwise. Maybe there was someone out there to claim your heart, hold it gently and take you to heights never before experienced. The only problem was that you had no idea who they were - all you had to go on was an address and some rather distinguished handwriting, words which managed to creep into your soul day by day and make the prospect of love very real."
"Eren is the leader of a gang. His alias is Joker and the name suits him pretty well once you get to know him. Levi is also the leader of a gang, the two are constantly in a fight but all of that changes once they meet face to face and need to work together to get rid of a third gang in town; the Titans. Together they find a way to face their fears and grief over the dead. Together they find out who they really are deep down and that love overcomes everything."
"It started out as a fairytale: date nights, cuddle sessions, deep conversations. Until one night he snapped, and Levi couldn't stop him. It didn't matter, though; he apologised and swore it wouldn't happen again. Then the cheating started. And the lying. And it just got worse and repeated itself until it was routine for Eren to degrade Levi every morning and fuck him into oblivion by nightfall. There's a soloution, Levi knows it; it just lies on a farm full of secrets and the last thing he expected: Hope."
"This was it. This was what they fought for. So what would it take for them to finally enjoy it?"
"Sometimes things happen that shake your world and make it crumble. These little earthquakes leaving you to rebuild and start over. After crossing paths with another shattered soul, you both learn that love might be what you need to fill in the cracks."

"The year is 2153. Carbon dioxide levels on planet Earth have led to the human race - or those that can afford it - abandoning their home planet for orbital colonies scattered across the solar system. But people want to be grounders again. Humans who might have never even set foot on real, solid ground long for another world that they can‚Äôt destroy with the same mistakes. Ymir has yearned for the stars far longer than she has been a starship pilot for the IASA. Home holds nothing but bad memories and worse regrets. She searches for answers amongst the constellations, longs for some semblance of purpose in the universe, begs black holes for a second chance at the things she has left behind on Earth. On a frontier mission to the heart of the Milky Way, plundering new stars for hospitable planets upon which to replant the human race, Ymir's resolve as a captain is tested in ways she never quite expected when a diversion off-course results in an inexplicable discovery that terrifies her beyond measure.

"The rattle of his front door did nothing to stir Eren as he continued to stare at the video of the courtroom before him. ‚ÄúLevi Ackerman, this jury finds you guilty of twelve counts of murder in the first degree and hereby sentences you to the maximum penalty equal to that of your crimes in the form of twelve consecutive life sentences to be served in a maximum security penitentiary without the possibility of parole,‚Äù a woman‚Äôs voice spoke through the speakers. Eren felt his heart clench. ‚ÄúEren,‚Äù said a voice from behind him. Armin had come to visit once again. He felt a hand press onto his shoulder from where he sat, trying to garner attention away from his Raven. ‚ÄúEren‚Ä¶ This is unhealthy. You need to eat... You need to sleep‚Ä¶ I need you to take care of yourself, please,‚Äù Armin said with a hoarse voice, choked by the state of his best friend. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Eren said, shrugging off his hand. ‚ÄúWhat I need to do is be here for Levi when he needs me.‚Äù"

Thankfully, a man called Levi is there to keep him safe (although be it begrudgingly, at first)."
"Annie and Mikasa try to have a baby."
"Eren and Levi thought that nobody would understand, when in reality, they were more alike than they thought. Eren is a nerd and a bit of an otaku and Levi is captain of the football team, when they first meet, they don't thin much of each other. But, will their unmistakable ""lack of interest"" for each other be the beginning of something beautiful? Or is this some other way life decided to mess with them?

"Levi runs a gentle finger down the tiny slope of her nose, presses a kiss to her forehead. ‚ÄúI think she has your nose.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe poor child,‚Äù Erwin sighs sadly, shaking his head. ‚ÄúHopefully, she has your eyebrows.‚Äù Levi glances up. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see anything wrong with your eyebrows.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou know what they say.

"Being with one person your whole life is a mirrage provoked by the romanticising of the one true love. It is much more realistic to believe that you will be with several people, each one drawn in your life depending on the period in your development as a person. This story is a nerrative of five of those people, who played an important part in your life."

Therefore when he was found out about being an omega, he began taking medication after his first heat. Eren, his secretary and an alpha, found out where Levi hid his medication by accident. But he threw them out when he wasn't looking. When Levi went looking for his medication, he found out it was thrown away and went out looking for it. At that time Eren had already known Levi would be in heat and he took the chance to make Levi his and only his. Becoming pregnant was not an option for levi. He had to stay in the army so he found a blackmarket where abortion pills were sold to omegas. In the end, Eren figured it out and murdured the shop owner. That's where the story begins."

"Eren left. No one leaves Levi. He found him, and he'll never let go again. This a DARK fanfic. It's not fluff, it's not sunshine and rainbows, it's dark.

"Levi sits and waits.  He has no idea how much time has passed since they returned.  Time no longer works the way it did Before .  It slips away from him now, trickling through his fingers like dust. He spends hours sitting by the window in the mess hall,  tie in hand, the familiar green stone smooth, warm and solid in his palm. The hardest thing to bear is the simple absence, the fact that Erwin is no longer here."
"Levi had lost everything; his family, his home, his job and his friends ‚Äì turning to drugs and alcohol just to forget all of the pain he felt inside. Once being quite the success story, he was an ever so popular workaholic who fell off the rails after an unfortunate event that rendered him an orphan.

Levi would keep chasing after him, holding Eren's words close to his heart from their destined meeting.

""It smells like a human"" he proceeded. They all stepped back when it moved its wings. So, it's still alive but unconscious.

Its roots travelled all to way through the surrounding bushes; and its branches, let little light show through its foliage. But that's not what Squad Leader Erwin and his comrades stared at with glimmering eyes. No, it was something much more endearing; much more intricate.

Levi stops him, touching at Eren‚Äôs elbows, and Eren pauses, his cute, bushy eyebrows knitting together in confusion. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Eren asks, the slightest lilt of worry seeping into his tone. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want me to-‚Äù ‚ÄúLeave it down,‚Äù Levi orders, soft in the strictest of ways. ‚ÄúJust leave it down.‚Äù * In which Levi wakes up feeling disoriented and confused, yet everything seems to be right with the world when he feels like nothing should be.

"A wave of something indescribable washes over  him, like longing but so much more bitter. It‚Äôs twisted and dark. Like some swampish black and dirty facsimile of what he felt for Erwin in those early days. ‚ÄúWhat do you want, Zeke?‚Äù He breathes. ‚ÄúAn opportunity‚Äù Zeke says, carefully, as though he‚Äôs picking through the words to find the perfect ones. ‚ÄúA chance to put this to rest. An opportunity to test if ties really do bind, Levi, Make some new ones. Am I really such a terrible alternative?‚Äù Levi considers it; Considers the tension and fear that‚Äôs been wrought through him since Zeke first started staring at him like a specimen and not an adversary. He thinks about the hopelessness he feels like a constant companion. There is nothing left, he thinks sickeningly, absolutely nothing left to lose."

Levi remembers another life. One so cruel he begs the universe that it isn't real but the utter clarity with which he can recall it says otherwise. Hanji doesn't remember, no matter how much he prompts her, leaving him lonely, desperate, and questioning his sanity. Until he runs into Eren, who addresses him by his familiar old title. And somewhere in between the anger and the betrayal, there's a little something that feels an awful lot like relief, and Levi is weak to it."

It must be a coincidence, he reasoned himself, someone must have called him as well in the middle of this mist or... ‚Äú...Marcel?‚Äù With that skeptical whisper and the way those hazel eyes blinked at him, they both realized they could, at the very least, see each other for who knows how long. (set during chapter 139) In which Marcel and Porco are able to exchange some words to Reiner at the end of the battle."
"The first time you and Levi spend the night together isn‚Äôt quite what you were expecting."
"You are a sniper for an organization called the Warriors, who exterminate devils. Devils being blood-sucking murderers who have caused chaos thorough out Shiganshina in recent years.

"You are a hunter of Gods. You are contracted, with your best friend, to kill Gods who have violated the laws of the world too much. As you carry out your job, you are trained in combat by Levi and your mind trained by Erwin. As you work hard, your past is slowly revealed in flashbacks as the reason behind the cracked scar on your face becomes known. As the flashbacks come for you, so do you open up more to your master Levi. You are reluctant to get close to anyone, because you are mixed in your race with which horned race you belong to. You have one white horn and another black, meaning two clans have a say on your life. The one unique thing about you that no one understands are your orange fire like eyes, that the more you connect with Levi, the more they look like a galaxy. To learn about your missing father, to overcome your past, to open yourself to love and to fight the dislike on your being mixed, you have to discover what you really are before your past consumes you and takes you over."
"Levi Ackerman is the best they've got. That and his little shit of a cousin, but regardless, he's the best. The Ackermans were notorious Underground for their crimes. The three of them--erasing whatever they deemed was filthy in exchange for some blood money. Though, above ground is a different story. Above ground Levi Ackerman works at his family's tea and flower shop with his little cousin. Hanji Zo√´ is the craziest they've got. She's bursting at the seams with unconventional ideas and for some reason that no one can explain--her plans almost always seem to work. However, her job is becoming increasingly difficult especially when the thugs of the Underground are doing it for her--well, more like erasing all her evidence. And Hanji'll do anything to figure out who the fuck is messing with her career. Anything. Simply put, Levi and Hanji are intertwined with each other whether they fucking like it or not. A/N: Just a lil' note here, I plan on making this a long fic and I try to update 1-2 chapters per WEEK (sometimes i drop more) ‚ô•Ô∏è"

"Writing is survival, so that's just what Levi does. He writes and writes. He writes words. Phrases. Anything. Maybe to pass the time until he dies, maybe to get things off his mind. Levi doesn't know, but what he does know is that he will always love Erwin Smith."
"(SPOILERS FOR AOT/SNK CHAPTER 139) It was three years since the Battle of Heaven and Earth and the end of the titan-ridden world as they knew it. Levi, Gabi, Falco, and Onyankopon were one day surprised by the arrival of a strange girl and a strange boy in a foreign airship. The boy, Killua, and the girl, Alluka, posed an interesting possibility for Levi and the other Eldians: the granting of almost any wish they wanted. And so, Levi and the others wrestled with the question of whether they wanted to regain the things they had lost or continue living a life of acceptance and rest. Meanwhile, Killua looked at Levi and the Eldians and was reminded of Gon, a friend who had also lost an ability that made him who he was. Killua and Alluka were then also forced to confront what it could look like for Alluka to give up a power that have both opened up possibilities and made her a monster."

Eren is a bastard soldier from another world on a vengeance quest to end a war. They meet in the middle, and their relationship begins with blood. From there it gets more complicated."

"Levi needed to save Erwin. He needed to save the one who saved him. But, how was he supposed to do that when there were two screaming children, begging for the serum to be used in their friend. Or a fellow comrade going on and on about how much of a demon Erwin was. He didn't want to make him suffer any more than he had to, but any choice he made will end with somebody unhappy. Whether it was Levi or the others. They just had to make it difficult. ~~~ Basically Levi's thoughts on the matter of who to give the titan serum to. (Spoiler alert- It's Armin)"
"Mordant (adj): 1. Biting and caustic in thought, manner, or style, 2. acting as a mordant (as in dyeing), 3. burning, pungent. Derived from the Latin word mordere (to bite). Reader‚Äôs period arrives with a side of hellfire symptoms, causing confusion and tension between Levi and his s/o."
"""Reiner was a monster and so was she. Only he was a worm, and she was a rattlesnake. Or much worse. There was probably a better comparison, but she knew so little of the world. Maybe it was better that way. Maybe it was better that Ymir had abandoned her and died, so she would not have to see what had become of the girl she loved. Ymir would never have to see what had become of the worst girl in the world."""

"All of his life, Winston was surrounded by walls, but he never felt trapped by them. Strangely enough, he found comfort in them, comfort that something so tall and strong could keep him safe. Whenever he looked up, sunlight always peeked over, making the ledge seem endless. But he never wanted to know what was over on the other side, all he wanted was to reach the top to look down at his little world before finally reaching his end."
"""I'm so sorry, Jean..."" Jean doesn't know how to reply. He doesn't really want to. All he can think of right now, and all he's been able to think about for the last few days, is how he could have prevented this; how he could have been less of an idiot. All he had wanted to do was be a hero."
"There is a moment before Armin finishes helping Eren up into the airship where Levi entertains the notion that since leaving them, Eren has presented as an omega. But then all that is washed away with the stench of him‚ÄîEren‚Äôs an alpha and Levi‚Äôs an alpha and that changes nothing and Levi thinks, fuck , and no , and, I can‚Äôt do this again ."
"Something is very wrong in Paradis, a place where dead things linger and nothing is as it seems. When Erwin arrives in the quiet countryside town, longing to leave his past behind, he only has one goal: To uncover the mystery surrounding the infamous Magnolias, a family haunted by death and tragedy, and possibly more sinister things. During his investigations into the supernatural, he encounters Levi, a local with a grudge against tourists, who knows more than he lets on and seems to be running from his very own ghosts. As Erwin gets closer to Levi and begins to uncover the twisted history of the long empty Magnolia Mansion, strange things start happening, and he becomes inextricably tangled in the town's net of mysteries. Soon, Erwin isn't sure if there is a way out, or if the things that lie unseen will devour him before he can find the answers he's looking for."
"Canon divergence, post-ACWNR events | Levi hadn‚Äôt paid much attention to Squad Leader Hange Zo√´ the first time they met, too caught up in their plan to take Erwin Smith down. However, in the aftermath of his first expedition ‚Äìand in spite of saying he didn‚Äôt want to be responsible for anyone else‚Äôs lives‚Äì Levi can‚Äôt refuse the helping hand Hange is lending for him to take. Accepting, it is probably a choice he might come to regret later because the squad leader seemed the type of person who just roots into one‚Äôs heart, making it impossible harder letting go ‚Äìif time came."

"‚ÄúLook, Levi! It‚Äôs another frog!‚Äù Hange pointed out. Levi held her on his back, carrying her across the muddy path leading back home. The weather turned from a downpour into a light rain so naturally, Hange dragged Levi out from his home to look at the frogs and worms that emerged during the drizzle.

"The words Levi had wanted to say were right there, on the tip of his tongue, but he had always been bad with words. What he actually said, made him want to hang up, throw the phone as far away as he could, curl up and die."

"People behind the walls have never experienced what freedom feels like. They've never felt the wind stroking their skin, birds chirping playfully and the sun shining briefly into their faces. Of course, there are many ways a person can feel free. But once a human experiences this feeling, it's something they can't get enough of. The more they ignore the craving, the more the feeling gets stronger. Eventually, they get addicted to the way how it feels, and they're willing to do anything to have a piece of the deliciously sounding word."
"I looked back at the never-ending ocean as another crash of the cool water soaked my feet. The eggshell white sand slightly irritated the bottom of my feet as the deep blue waves came crashing in to soothe the pain.

"The future had played out exactly as Eren had seen it, had intended it. It had ended with his death, ended with freedom.

"The world could be a cruel, wicked place, filled with nightmares and terrors unending. Erwin Smith made the choice to throw himself into those nightmares, but even the most steadfast man is not an island. At the very least, there was someone he could fall back on, even if it took him some time to realize it. A girl, unlike anyone else he'd ever laid eyes on. Her hair... just like in his father's books... like the people who once lived outside the Walls... (Erwin-centric. The slowest of slow burns. No secret Ackermans or Azumabitos, here, folks)"

The hangman, dressed in black clothes, ties the knot around his throat. As he steps up to the falling door, the hangman asks, as gentle as if he were a lover: and what do you call that kind of justice?

"The first minutes after his death, he was too preoccupied with his survival to question why he was still breathing. The first hours, he tried to find a way out. The first weeks, he looked inward in search of who he really was. It was only when the months piled on with neither answers nor relief that he grew to understand that no one stood the test of time in the face of eternity ‚Äî least of all someone who had demons to face.

The colours of spring hypnotize him, the heat of summer burns him, the winds of autumn sober him, and the chill of winter petrifies him. It is even more astounding that all these seasons, all these transformations, are shown by Hizuru's princess, someone he's forbidden to even lay eyes upon.

"""You have time for one visitor before your execution. Who would you like to see?"" In the confines of a prison cell, Eren Jaeger smiles a grim smile. That's an easy question. There is only one person he wants to see. Lay eyes on him one last time and he'll die with no regrets. He looks up and levels the guard with a calm stare. ""I want Levi"" he says simply."
"Eren is strong. Unbreakable, and yet. He is fragile. So, so, fragile. Sometimes Armin feels as if all it would take was one more person, one more death, one more betrayal. For that is all Eren has known, and that is all Eren is. In all his beautiful glory, Eren is a destructive torrent of devastating anger and hate. Nothing more, nothing less. And yet. And yet Eren, in all his eminence, is able to love. Which is more, so much more than others can say. So much more than Armin can say. But love is a complicated thing. Love corrupts, it twists and it distorts. It is so much easier to hate. But hate isn‚Äôt the opposite of love. It is indifference. And that is a painful thing to realise indeed."

"A deep-set shock had gripped her, had rattled her to her core as she recognized the face she knew like the back of her hand below all the blood, gashes and shrapnel. For a second, she had assumed the worst. But his body was warm underneath her touch. And as she lay her hand discreetly on his chest, the heart below her palm thumped. It was the same, familiar rhythm she heard all the time as she lay against him during the nights when sleep evaded the two of them. Still steady. Still beating. And it was in that moment when Hange swore: No matter what- even if it cost her own life- she was going to make sure that Levi would stay alive."
"Love is complicated, Zoe had always thought. So why did he make it so easy?"
"No matter how many times he does it, no matter how hard he tears into his own body with soaps too harsh for his skin, he never feels any less disgusting. He never feels any less awful. He never forgets the blood, or the mud, or the shit. He never lets the people out of his head, and never forgets their names, and he certainly never forgets their corpses.

But when his dreams of a better life begin to collect a body count, he realizes this ""Other Self"" has grown into more than a side effect."
"While recuperating from the Female Titan‚Äôs attack, Levi frantically searches for Petra."
"Levi has played around before. He's let his mind wander and form his wildest dreams, sticking to only one principle: Never give them a name"
"‚ÄúHere,‚Äù he snaps, and digs through his pocket until he feels that velvet box that cost him almost an entire paycheck. And for what? The thing is fucking useless now, sitting inside a container that Levi can‚Äôt bring himself to open."
"""Eren,"" ""Levi,"" ""This water; it's fucking cold,"" A short breath passed Eren's parted lips, that were stained a concerning blue. A puff of white mixed between their mouths, as the cold was all they could feel. ""Do you really want those to be your final words?"" ""Don't be a pessimistic shit, we'll survive this,"" ""Ah, you're right..,"""
"The existence of Titans have been long gone from the world. For so long in fact - they are nothing more than a legend - some elaborate fairy tale told to children. Everyone is now living in mostly peace and have spread to the far corners of the earth. Life has never been so blissful! Until a young man is tasked with stopping a dark scheme that could destroy everything they have come to know. Along the way its discovered that so-called legends have a foot in the truth.

"He pushes away from her and paces the room, eyes burning and bright and furious. She watches him, blinking rapidly to clear her vision, and folds her arms over her chest. She feels suddenly very bare without her gear. He stops then, abrupt, and twists to face her. And then he‚Äôs grabbing her again, this time with one hand fisted in the back of her hair and the other clamped around her bruised waist. And he‚Äôs kissing her."
"Levi gets humiliated during a trip to the market with the new recruits. One shot"
"Original Title, I know. Eren is a mermaid. Mermanity is now a word. (Like humanity??? get it??) Eren Jaeger has a happy enough life. He spends his time collecting shells, avoiding pirates and dreaming about the surface world. But when mermanities oldest foe, 'The Titans' shatter his peaceful reality, he finds himself seeking solace in the one thing (Or Person) he's been told to avoid his whole life."

"Eruri drabble collection with an inclination towards canonverse. Ratings are included for each individual chapter. Prompts are welcome on Tumblr !"
"Who the hell would be stupid enough to visit Jean Kirschtein at 2am during a thunderstorm? Eren Jaeger, of course. While his old rival could be stubborn at times, something is wrong for him to come to Jean of all people. Once Eren begins to open up about things, Jean begins to understand where shit hit the fan for his friend and helps him as best he can. By trading insults and offering tough love. Be prepared for a lot of dumb humor and angry boyfriends being nerds."
"Eren Jaeger is a nobody. He's not attractive, he's not smart, and he's not strong. He also gets bullied a lot, mostly for being gay. Yet, somehow he works up his courage and manages to confess his feelings to the ever popular Levi Ackerman! After being brutally turned down though, Eren begins to grow somewhat violent, needing something to take his anger out on. He wasn't strong, though, and usually ended up losing every fight his partook in. And by some twisted turn of events, Eren ends up dating one of the guys who bullied him; Jean Kirschtein. Over the summer Eren starts working out with Jean. He fixes up his appearance and toughens himself up, deciding that he would definitely start getting the respect he deserved from others. When school starts up again, nobody can believe it's the same kid that you'd usually find shoved into a locker. And that includes Levi. So what happens when Levi tries to seduce Eren? Will Eren be able to remain faithful to his boyfriend, or will past feelings recuperate?"
"Levi gets an unexpected visitor one night that opens the door to a world that he always wanted to keep closed."

"Here's a collection of drabble based on the tumblr post about ""things said______"" applied to JeanMarco. Be expecting some angst."
"One day Levi leaves Eren without really telling him why or when he will come back. ""I don't have the time to explain. Eren, don't worry, I'll eventually come back. Be a good boy and wait for me."" As the days go on, Eren meets different people that will influence his life and his decisions. Time passes and Eren is somewhat willing to let go of Levi and start a new life. Or will he? It's up to the readers to come up with ideas and decide what happens next. Will Levi come back? What are his intentions for leaving? What relationships will form during Eren's life?"
"For every time that they're together, their hearts and minds do not hesitate to open up. A string of few LeviHan fics that I've accumulated over the past months. Basically, this is my LeviHan drabble dump."
"On a relatively straight-forward trip outside of the walls, Eren is seriously injured and Levi is forced to face up to feelings he's been trying to ignore for entirely too long.  Watching the titan-shifter clinging onto life, the foul-tempered Corporal comes to the sudden realisation that perhaps he might not get the chance to tell the brat how he feels after all."
"Some scars don't heal with time. Levi knows it very well."
"Levi looks at Eren expectantly. Eren took the invitation. ‚ÄúSo, here I am just blabbing like an idiot. You‚Äôre probably not even gay, but‚Ä¶will you go out to dinner with me one time?‚Äù That was the first time he realized he liked Eren Jaeger."
"A/N: Essentially, the one in which Levi ditches his car and ends up half-frozen on Eren‚Äôs doorstep, and then falls harder for Eren in four days than he‚Äôs ever fallen for anyone in his life. Basically, this story shall contain roaring fires, hot chocolate, a whole roster of adorable animals (cause Eren‚Äôs spending his reading week watching over Hanji‚Äôs farm in frozen Alberta, whereas Levi is an author who lives in Vancouver), a bunch of cuteness with Eren and Levi bonding over nerdy shit; and, essentially, Levi and Eren being trapped together for days, with both of them realizing just how compatible they are, and with both of them aware of the fact that they're from different worlds and live entire provinces apart. - - - Levi‚Äôs known this kid for maybe four hours. There‚Äôs no reason for him to feel this protective. The wind‚Äôs still howling outside, though, and Levi still can‚Äôt feel his toes. Eren may well have saved his life, by opening his door. Maybe Levi‚Äôs allowed to feel a bit protective in return. - - - Now with gorgeous chapter ten art by strawberryxtruffles . Thank you so much, m'dear. :)"
"Levi remembers but Eren doesn't. And whether or not he remembers, they are both still haunted by it."
"Getting into a fight with Eren for the umpteenth time lands Jean an assignment at Wall Rose's pigeon post as punishment, where he meets the daughter of a garrison soldier and learns more than he ever wanted to about pigeons."
"None"
"Humanity is being slowly built back up; their relationship slowly breaks down."
"Levi confesses to cheating. Erwin sweats a lot."
"After an exceptionally difficult day of training, Armin begins to wonder if he is cut out to be a soldier."
"Levi tells stories. Mikasa and Jean‚Äôs daughter tries to figure out why Levi (almost) never smiles. Or ‚ÄúLevi?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, Eren?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you remember what happened right after the coronation?‚Äù Levi narrows his eyes. ‚ÄúMany things happened. What exactly?‚Äù"

"""5/12/15 Dear Levi Ackerman, You may be wondering, why the actual fuck is there a letter with your handwriting in a suspiciously colored envelope. Well, it's me. Well, you? In the future. Ten years from now, you are a lonely soul."" There is a new student, Eren Yeager. What's his story? And why do I have a letter with my name on it saying I'm in love with him, and that he is going to die? Who is this guy? And how is he so important? Those were Levi's first thoughts when he realized that the letter he received wasn't lying, and was basically giving him directions to a happy life. But, who is Eren? And why does he make such an impact on Levi's life 10 years from now? A story of love, drama, and inevitable love triangles."
"[JeanMarco] Modern!AU where Marco is the cute neighbor who moves into the vacant apartment next to Jean. Jean, sadly, is pretty much a lazy college student who prefers the safe haven of his house than the warm bustling city outside. Guess he's waking up earlier now just to see Marco water his plants and hang out his laundry. Before he knew it, he's pretty much head over heels over the cutie, and, well, very gay. However, after he gets to know more about Marco, unforeseen circumstances take place and Jean realizes he landed himself into something he will probably never be able to get out of."
"‚ÄúCan‚Äôt sleep?‚Äù Her voice was low and sluggish. Levi leaned his elbows on the stone barrier, eyes idly scanning the moonlit fields that surrounded the castle the scouting regiment was using as a temporary bunkhouse. He simply sipped his tea in response. ‚ÄúMe neither.‚Äù"
"""I love you."" --- (Although this is a writing I made about Hange and Levi there are no pronouns or anything as such, so you can imagine any other pairing.)"
"When  his parents and Mikasa die in a car wreck at the age of twelve, Eren is lost and lonely, until he meets Levi.  After being together for eight years, he loses Levi to cancer and is thoroughly broken.  He sees Levi everywhere, talks to him, argues with him, and even if he knows its not real Eren doesn't truly want him to disappear.  If it means he's sick, he doesn't want to get better.  A year after Levi's death he gets a letter from him, written before he passed.  Levi wants Eren to move on, go back to school, move out of their house, and make something of his life.  Find someone else.  Try to be happy.  So Eren packs his bags, goes back to school, and tries to put the pieces back together.  Wonders if it's possible, since there will always be one missing."
"In the summer of 1911, Marco finds himself and his adopted siblings alone in the middle of the French countryside, with no way to return home, and no idea how they got there. Jean hates France, France hates Jean, and they're both content to leave it that way, until brown eyes and freckles like stars put that mutual loathing to the test."
"The story of Eren and Levi is told years later when archaeologists search through the chaos which the war left behind to uncover answers. Turns out the archaeologists found a vein of gold in terms of history, and emotions. Maybe what they found should have stayed buried under the rubble together with the embracing corpses."
"I'm not letting go of Non-Bianry Hanji so I won't be giving them she/her or him/his pronouns hence all the they/their"
"Historical AU: Contrary to popular belief, men can get quite lonely while they are away at war. The seek the companionship of others who calm them, and relationships aren't surprising between two males. Why not go for it, when at any second they could die? Levi finds it downright annoying when he is constantly pressured to find a companion. That's not what he believes. He only wants a relationship based on love and trust, not lust. That's why he's content waiting for his beautiful fiance, Petra Ral. But when he saves a bright eyed brat, he's forced to re-evaluate his thoughts on a relationship. Will he go with the brat...or wait for his fiance?"
"(For the 2015 Jearmin Summer Splash: Prompt: ""The duty of youth is to challenge corruption"") Armin and Jean worry what they will turn into over time."
"Renaissance, Italy. Thinking is strictly censored by the Church, yet Armin wishes to share his discoveries with the world, all the while falling in love with someone who is very much forbidden."
"Connie and Jean have been best friends ever since they had a dorm together in college. Connie is used to Jean's hookups, and thinks nothing of the guys and girls that leave Jean's bedroom early in the morning. He has his own problems to worry about, like the growing strain on his relationship with his girlfriend Sasha. All of this becomes a lot more complicated when Connie notices that Jean's latest boyfriend is embarrassed of their relationship, and using him for sex. It bothers Connie so much, and in a way he's not used to. Because he looks at Jean now the way he looked at Sasha, and he knows he would never treat Jean like that if it was him.  Assuming he liked guys of course, but he doesn't..."
"Eren loves stargazing. It‚Äôs something he picked up from Marco, although he thinks they approach it from fundamentally different angles. (eremarco week day 5: lights/stars)"
"Podfic of ""This Feeling I'll Forget"" by: thefangirlingdead - Levi suffers from short term memory loss, and while that makes it hard for him to find love, he finds Erwin."
"Levi is eight and there are two things he remembers the most clearly about Eren Jaeger: 1. he likes apple juice 2. he likes girls. Levi, seventeen, realising that he‚Äôs been in love with his best friend for ever and he hadn‚Äôt even realised this until now. Eren, who likes girls. Levi is eighteen and he has no idea how to go about his sinful obsession with Eren Jaeger. Written for cerisecandy as an extremely overdue birthday present! (I'm so sorry Audrey)"
"It's mankind's primal yearning to touch the stars, discover the universe in all it's infinite glory; he sees the most beautiful parts of the world in her, his need for it tearing him apart, and he is only comforted by the knowledge that he's not alone in his longing for the unattainable. (PetruoWeek 2015)"
"He can usually ignore it, but even Armin has his limits. [ Trigger warning for gender dysphoria. There is a happy ending, however.]"

"Shortly after the beginning of the new century, deep-space surveillance led to an alarming conclusion: the Earth would soon be struck by a group of small asteroids. In desperation, the Federation of Central Sina developed Stonewall, a massive anti-air ballistic weapon, in the center of the Three Sisters continent. The weapon, for the most part, worked. However, after the danger passed, Sina realized just how powerful a weapon it had. Using Stonewall, The Sina National Coalition established air superiority over the entire Three Sisters Territory. Conventional ground forces were no match for aerial barrage from the Sina air force, and Legion forces were forced to retreat to the island of Trost, beyond Stonewall's range. Weakened and fragmented, Legion learns of a final air strike to be conducted on their headquarters and scrambles what few elite pilots it has left to counter-attack. Follow the efforts of Legion, mostly through the eyes of one of its most elite pilots, as they take on a vital role in Legion‚Äôs efforts to defeat the SNC and finally end the war. *Better Summary is better!*"
"Erwin and Jean are separated on an expedition and Jean doesn't come back... for a while."
"Levi‚Äôs a dick. Eren likes dick. Eren likes Levi‚Äôs dick.. Eren likes books! (This is the angstyest, stupidest most destructive thing I have ever written. Despite what the summary says this story is not for the faint of heart.. Read with caution, I'm sure there are plenty of triggers.) -----Editing in progress!-----"

"Angsty Rivetra oneshot.  Levi thought she'd always be there - but that makes it all the more harder when she's gone."
"Levi will always stand at Erwin's side."
"I fell in love with Jean when we were twelve, and he pushed me off the harbor ‚Äòcause I was too scared to jump. At the time, I thought we were going to be together forever. I guess life had other plans for us."
"A few of my favorite one shots pulled from my DA. Most stories are Reader/Levi but I have a few for Eren, Armin & Erwin. They're all scattered between drabbles, song fics,PWP, & humor/sarcasm centric. A few are in canon but most are in Modern AUs. I'll post a few at a time depending on the free time I have to transfer everything over~ These are all posted under my DA Profile~PetiteGalaxy"

"Another quick one shot. Eren is dead and Levi is grieving. Angst."
"Mikasa's first confrontation with Levi"
"Eren's feelings towards his Captain only increase the closer they get to their next, most dangerous as of yet, mission. He tries to respect Levi enough and keep his little crush to himself but it seems like the older man is far more observant than he'd initially believed him to be. Yet, as Levi keeps pushing him away, Eren starts to figure out that perhaps his Captain is hiding something of his own. Who is Levi exactly? How compassionate is he? What's up between him and Erwin? Why is his sense of humour so atrociously bad? What makes him tick? Most of all, how deeply exactly does he care for the young boy?"
"He remembered the time in horrendous detail: The fear of a new day and new horrors that plagued the men, women, and children of Europe that not even the Devil could create. It was a time where he feared that if the fighting just stopped, he would see the true monster that the war created out of him. Yet nothing would compare to the accumulation of grief and guilt that grew over those few short years, no matter how hard he tried to repress it. He would be branded throughout the rest of his life...if he survived."
"""I think Levi views Erwin as a guiding light, sort of. No matter what happens around Levi, it's a comfort having Erwin who will never waver and keep moving forward. Someone who understands the same pain as you, someone who has the same ambitions as you and someone who will keep guiding you to your destination."""
"Erwin Smith, from the Austrian mountains, has only one dream: to go to America and live in luxury. Yet with his arm blown off by a shell, he is sent to work at a household in Poland. It's there he meets a man behind a long, high fence, with gaunt cheeks and burning eyes. ""His breath must have felt hot and sharp ‚Äì Erwin feels heavy with sadness and delirious with delight at the sight of this almost skeletal man eating the food that he had stolen from the crooked house. He looks at the fine, squirrel-like bones of Levi‚Äôs hands and the criminal way he grabbed at cakes so they squished into his palm ‚Äì so many things broke so easily in Nazi Germany and he hopes this will not break."""
"Eren left four years ago for college in Germany and Jean never quite understood why he was angry about it. Why wouldn't he *want* his greatest rival to leave? Eren returns four years later with something to hide and to find Jean worse than he was when he left."
"""You'll feel at ease with him,"" Mikasa had insisted. ""You'll see."" Seven months and fourteen days later, he's feeling the cavity of his rib-cage being hollowed out bit by bit in the shape of Levi's name, and it's anything but easy. (Wherein Eren learns, painstakingly, the purpose of implicit rules.)"
"After a one night stand, Armin finds himself in a life long commitment...just not one he was quite ready for."
"Lance Corporal Levi Ackerman meets you, a headstrong young cadet and becomes completely enamored over time, but outside and inside forces threaten to tear you away from him for good. His biggest obstacle may turn out to be himself, but you certainly aren't willing to give him up without a fight."
"Jean Kirschtein absolutely despised autumn. He'd lost his best friend, but he still felt like he was around."
"The 104th military program isn't what everyone was made to believe- nothing is. With the teens being experimented on and changed into beings that are not what the laws of nature dictate to be human, Armin and Annie struggle to come to terms with the fact that everything they knew before has been forever changed. With the lives of their friends, and themselves, on the line, it's up to the duo to find a way out to warn the Survey Corporations of the Trainee Division‚Äôs wrongdoings. But with officers hot on their trail, will it be possible?"
"Erwin and Levi talk."
"For Ms. Amy, the owner of the tumblr URL ARUANI for her 22nd birthday! Love you Amy!!!!"
"Eren Jaeger dreams of living in a world where his sister is alive and he doesn‚Äôt have to use his treasured coping mechanisms to feel something other than pain. But life has a way of crushing everything in its destructive path, and Eren finds himself in a downwards spiral that doesn‚Äôt appear to be heading up anytime soon. As captain of Shiganshina High's football team, Levi Ackerman acts as a pillar of support for his teammates. But once he‚Äôs off the field and out of his jersey, he becomes just Levi . Levi Ackerman may be able to help other people, but Levi sure as hell can‚Äôt fend for himself against his alcoholic uncle. No one else has felt their pain, no one else has lived through what they have, and no one else will ever understand them. But everything changes once they strike up an unconventional relationship that forces them to bare all of their scars."
"1943. The war had been raging on for three years, twenty two year old Levi Ackerman has come face to face with the draft. He must now fight for his country. With no family left to see him off, he runs into a young man, Eren Jeager, an intern journalist. With only the image of a bleak future in his mind, he entrusts the young man with his family‚Äôs key, telling him to keep in touch with him if he lives. He leaves Eren with his information and sets off for war. Along the way Eren comes face to face with activists, veterans, egotists, and learns more about the horrid war this hopeless solider is involved in."
"I'm bleeding out. No hope. My time is limited. The phone keeps ringing. Jean. He can't know I'm dying. I can't tell him. I don't want this to be the last memory he has of me. But I need to hear his voice... One last time..."
"With the people he loves by his side, Erwin finds some beauty in the solace of death."
"Everything is perfect through Marco's eyes. Until he walks in on Jean and everything changes."
"Levi lives his life with the curse of inhabiting a monster inside his body. He changes into something that isn't human when the moon is at its fullest each month and goes on a killing spree. He can't do anything about it and tries to bear with the burden on his own with no one knowing of his condition besides his two close friends. He's terrified of what he is and how there is always the chance he will carry yet another innocent person's blood on his hands. Trying to protect everyone from the beast, Eren comes stumbling, quite literally, into one of his classes one day and their relationship takes off. While Levi is terrified of their relationship and fears for Eren's life, Eren just might be able to save Levi from the monster within."
"For all those who have fallen. Take a minute silence to honour their memories. The three regiments hold a remembrance service for all those who had died in the hands of a titan. For the young cadets, thinking of the falling comrades is the hardest thing they have ever had to do. Being strong in front of everyone was the most becoming unbelievably difficult. ""When can their glory fade? O the wild charge they made! All the world wondered. Honour the charge they made! Honour the Light Brigade, Noble six hundred!"""
"Sasha falls victim to her insecurities."
"‚ÄúOkay brat, you have two god damn choices. I can kill you now or you can become my pet.‚Äù Mafia/Fight Club AU where Levi is the head of some sketchy organization and Eren is a college drop out who accidentally discovers this underground paying field."
"The 104th is a group of teens that go on missions for an organization of a higher up they never met. They were all gathered together since they were smaller and grew into a very close-knit group. Eren, Armin, Mikasa, and Annie are known as the best and are usually together on most missions. When the whole group is called in for a mission that's supposed to be simple, questions start to arise. Why would they need everyone when there's only one man to kill and who is this group that's constantly following Eren? The Survey Corp is a group of professional hitmen. When out on a mission they run into a teen who is heavily armed and decides to bring him in. What happens when the supposedly cold Levi can't seem to keep his eyes off the gem-eyed brat."
"Based on the Tumblr Post: Levi and Eren get into an argument and harsh things were said. Levi stalks off to their room. He doesn‚Äôt bother saying good night to Eren because they‚Äôre both really angry with each other. Levi cries himself to sleep, he hates hurting Eren. Eren feels bad and goes to check on him when he‚Äôs asleep and sees the tear marks down his cheeks. Eren feels guilty so he hugs Levi the whole night. Levi wakes up because it‚Äôs usually so cold, why it is so warm, and finds Eren curled up against him and smiles. Everything‚Äôs okay again. I kinda tweaked the prompt a bit, but it's still full of angst and fluff! Sorry for the sucky summary, there is a longer one inside but it was too long to put here..."

But more than this, it is the struggle of men who start a revolution. Each journey starts with a step."
"He‚Äôll pretend that it doesn‚Äôt bother him. That he doesn‚Äôt hate the fact that no one knows. He‚Äôll pretend that everything ok, because he‚Äôs the only boy that Levi has been with this way; and somedays that‚Äôs enough."
"Levi is a long term prisoner sentenced for life and after 12 years of boredom he finally meets someone to challenge his mind.

It doesn‚Äôt happen often, but it‚Äôs not the first time Levi has turned up at his door when Erwin is too caught up in saving humanity or whatever the fuck he‚Äôs doing, to notice the desperation in Levi‚Äôs eyes, the need coursing through his veins. Mike sometimes wonders if he should feel guilty, wonders if he‚Äôs taking advantage.  Erwin and Levi are two of his closest friends after all.  But part of him can‚Äôt help thinking that if they can‚Äôt get their shit together, then tough, they might all be dead tomorrow, so he may as well take his chances.  And fuck, this is Levi, no one takes advantage of Levi unless he wants it. An angsty, smutty, Mikeri one shot."

"The chain dragged Hanji‚Äôs vehicle mercilessly forward. The armored car to which it was attached showed no signs of stopping. He looked forward again. The edge was visible. It was lined with rough and ragged rocks. She had to get out. Leaning out, he extended his hand. ‚ÄúHanji!‚Äù Abandoning her tenuous grip on the wheel, Hanji crawled across the seat. She reached out. Their fingers brushed. The chain groaned. Behind her, the Wistvern car spun, losing traction on the thinning sand. Beneath those dirty goggles, he could see brown eyes. For a fraction of a second, he saw nothing else. And then her car jerked back, caught up with the Wistvern car sliding over the edge. His fingers closed over empty air."
"Levi was the son of a barbaric King. One who had his own sense of justice, based on chance. He thought, if you were truly innocent, the odds would be in your favor right? The gods would always provide freedom to one who had done no wrong! That's why, instead of a trial, the accused party would have to pick between two large doors in an arena. One door contained someone beautiful and single for the accused to be married to on the spot. They would be acquitted of all crimes, even if they admitted guilt. The other door contained a hungry tiger, starved for days on end. The tiger would tear the accused apart, not heeding to reason or innocence. And at every trial, Levi sat on his throne alongside his King, looking on at the proceedings with cold eyes and a sophisticated demeanor.

Hanji and I will see you in a couple of weeks or so.‚Äù The two men shook hands and Levi strode out of the headquarters of Wolfe and Mann, Bail Enforcement Agents, slight limp still apparent in his stride.

Levi is the gatekeeper of the Northern Gate, the most important (and most troublesome) gate that keeps the human world safe from interference and invasion.  When he receives a letter from his cousin asking him to take on her friend for a summer apprenticeship he agrees against his better judgement. Neither of them is expecting the end of the world."

Kiara suspected that she wasn't a human born to be loved. And then the Jaeger's had adopted her. Being raised as their daughter for two years had given her insight into what it was like to be loved by your parents; Kiara just wished that she had more time with them before she left for the cadets.

Kailan nga ba? Iyan ang tanging tanong na halos dalawang taon na bumabagabag kay Annie simula nang iwan siya ni Armin. When did Armin fell and run out of love for her? Isang tanong na gusto lamang tanungin ng babae ngunit sa bawat araw na lumipas, hindi na rin siya sigurado kung maitatanong niya pa ba ito ng personal sa lalaki."

"Levi didn‚Äôt know how much more of this he could take. The countless lives he had ended‚Ä¶for what? To learn a little more about this mystery of a world? Bullshit. This was all bullshit. This world was good for one thing: pain and suffering. And that was all you needed to know about it.  The voices screamed louder and louder. He felt like his head was going to expl- ‚ÄúLevi...?

"They lie. When they were children, they were promised to each other. Generations of feuding lied with two royals, destined to unite warring nations. And they did, unite Hizuru and Marley. If only it didn‚Äôt ruin them in the process. They lie when they say they love each other, and though it was once true, Mikasa had loved Eren. Eren had loved Mikasa. Love fades, it deteriorates at the edges, folded, bent so many times so that they can no longer recognize that love. Though the opposite of love is not hate, it is indifference. - Or: AU where Mikasa and Eren have an arranged marriage but lost their childhood love for each other."
"Hilda and Levi both agreed to put the duties to the people in front of the duties to each other.

"Why you? You didn‚Äôt know the charming stranger was your target. As you infiltrate their business thats not the only thing you‚Äôre getting into, after dancing around each other and mixed communication it really does all build up until everything comes crashing down."
"‚ÄòI love you.‚Äô Three simple words that can often mean so much. Those words can be empty, they can be manipulative. It can‚Äôt be in any way fair that one person can use these words in such a malicious deceitful way when to the other person those syllables could mean the world. What if ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô wasn‚Äôt just empty words anyone could speak? What if saying those words bounds your life to the other person, making it impossible for you to live without them. Well that is the world that discreetly hopeless romantic Mikasa Ackerman lives in. She finds this world cruel yet also charming, she sees the pleasure in the pain of having to love someone forever at risk of your own life. That was until she found herself falling in love with the adorably stubborn Annie Leonhart, an ice cold girl who swore to never utter those words after she watched her mother die to the weight they hold. Annie only wants to mess around but Mikasa finds herself falling deeper everyday knowing that this girl would never want to love her even if she really did feel that way inside."

"Mikasa Ackerman didn't understand why she had vague memories of events that couldn't have possibly happened in her life. It was Shiganshina, in the year 845. There was no way those could've happened when she'd been living the same boring life inside the looming walls for the past ten years. But her headaches were getting more frequent by the day, and her dreams were always about the same thing: the echoing screams, the loud thuds of heavy footsteps, the smell of iron that hung in the air, and the death of her friend, Eren Yeager. She didn't understand why she always had vague memories of events that couldn't have possibly happened in her life. Until she was faced again with the echoing screams, the loud heavy footsteps, the smell of blood, and the death of Eren. And then she woke up. She was in Shiganshina, and the year was 845. And she felt like she just had the longest and most painful dream of her life. [An Attack on Titan AU based on the song ""Sa Susunod na Habang Buhay"" (In Our Next Lifetime) by Ben&Ben]"

"It happens like this: he‚Äôs sprinting through the streets of Marley, past the astonished eyes of the people whose lives he‚Äôs torn asunder, past the children darting through the streets like they did so long ago in Shiganshina, past the weight of the sins he bears, her small hands in his. They run and run and run, hand-in-hand, and for a moment, the world warps to back when they were nine years old. He grabs her hand. Wraps a red scarf around her neck. And as it flaps in the wind, the ribbon tying their fates together, he leads her home. Anywhere is fine. As long as it‚Äôs away from here. Eren, Mikasa, and waking from a long dream."

"The two are a picture together, really odd to the eye. Levi stands shrunken and offensive, ready to gauge out the eyes of anyone who dares get too close. Furlan‚Äôs been on the blunt end of that, been on the opposing side before stepping under Levi‚Äôs wingspan. It was a shield all these years, from the fear, the pain, the unknown of what each day, and it took countless acts of trust and devotion to get there. Like a trail of breadcrumbs left for a bird, trying to earn even a fraction of its gratitude just for a moment, and Levi‚Äôs a crow; dark as night and quicker than death. Erwin is something else entirely, all sunlight and power- the kind that comes from the mind and not the muscle, towering over Levi with the type of integrity he‚Äôs never seen before- if he‚Äôs ever been lucky enough to see any at all. His arms are the framework for a cage, grand in design and beautiful enough to trick you into thinking all that bronze and light is welcoming, like you want to be his prisoner. Levi‚Äôs falling for it, without even so much as a fight despite them being polar opposites. Erwin is gold against Levi‚Äôs steel, malleable in skill but sought out and valued.

"Five bodies, each of them another trauma added to Levi's ever growing collection. After Petra's father stopped him on the way back into Wall Rose, Levi couldn't take it. he composed himself, and continued on. Going through the motions, memorials, funerals, talking to family. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. He's been through it a thousand times, not once is it easier. (might not have more chapters)"
"9 years ago, Eren left this world behind. Now, he returns and things will have to irrevocably change."
"It's your senior year at Sina high and you're going to make the most of it with your friend group Eren, Mikasa, Armin, Jean, Connie, and Sasha. You've always had a thing for Eren but vowed to never tell him how you feel until one night... TW: drugs, drinking, abuse, swearing, smut, cringe (my writing improves as you go bear with me)"
"It's finally summer break and you decide to let go and fuck around with your friends. who knew it would be interrupted with jealous exes and drunken dads (my writing improves as you go bear with me)"
"‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt you heard? The king has announced his engagement! Everyone in the kingdom is celebrating tonight. We‚Äôre finally going to have a queen!‚Äù Levi watched Farlan‚Äôs eyes sparkle with excitement and knew his were wretchedly dull in comparison. Dull, grey, flat. Not beautiful, pretty, or something to be admired. Those were words used to describe women, not him. Not him, with his corded muscle and the patchwork of scars burned white across his chest. Not him with his constant glare and his inability to smile without looking manic. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll make sure to send my congratulations to the king.‚Äù ~~~ Levi was just hungry- he certainly didn‚Äôt ask for the Prince of all Eldia to take an interest in him. And he certainly didn‚Äôt ask for the hell that followed."
"Then all at once I know; I shouldn‚Äôt feel like this, I shouldn‚Äôt be this worried, but I am.  It‚Äôs not the task at hand that is keeping me here, it‚Äôs what I might find if I leave.  If I ask the commander, he won‚Äôt go.  If I ask Hanji, she won‚Äôt leave.  It has to be me, it has to be me."
"In wich Levi is (completely out of character) really confused about his feelings and has absolutely no idea how to deal with them so he resorts to going into a bathroom and crying like a baby, while simitaneously making Eren confused as hell. ~~ Levi had to take a moment, to just get a hold of himself. Because sweet Sina, save him. That was Eren Yeager, the litteraly man of Levi's dreams, sleeping peacefully -and gracefully mind him- on the other side of Levi's bed. He cursed himself silently. He had always told himself he would never let people get close after Isabel and Farlan died. Yet here he was, trying not to have his skin melt off of his face because this brunette brat of a Titan Shifter had gone and made Levi's little, dark, stone cold, shrivelled up heart beat so fast Levi felt like he may as well have run right from wall Maria to Wall Sina then back again. ~~ He gulped again and tore his eyes away from Eren's and managed to stand up fully. He was about to turn and just walk back to the bathroom but he chucked one last glance at Eren and froze up all over again - stuff this last glance bullshit why didn't Levi just turn around."
"‚ÄòWhat have you done to yourself now,‚Äô he said. No one else but Erwin heard him add, ‚ÄòYou fucking fool.‚Äô"
